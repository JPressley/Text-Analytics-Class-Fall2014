'''April''' is the fourth [[month]] of the [[year]], and comes between [[March]] and [[May]]. It has 30 [[day]]s. April begins on the same day of week as [[July]] in all years and also [[January]] in leap years.

April's [[flower]]s are the [[Sweet Pea]] and [[Asteraceae|Daisy]]. Its [[birthstone]] is the [[diamond]]. The meaning of the diamond is innocence.

== The Month ==
[[File:Colorful spring garden.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Spring]] flowers in April in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].]]
April comes between [[March]] and [[May]], making it the fourth month of the year. It also comes first in the year out of the four months that have 30 days, as [[June]], [[September]] and [[November]] are later in the year. It starts on the same day of the week as [[July]] every year, and starts on the same day as [[January]] in [[leap year]]s. In a [[common year]], April starts on the same day of the week as [[October]] of the previous year, and in [[leap year]]s starts on the same day as [[May]] of the previous year.
April ends on the same day of the week as [[December]] every year. In a [[common year]], it ends on the same day as [[July]] of the previous year. In a [[leap year]], it ends on the same day as [[October]] of the previous year.

April is a [[spring]] month in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and an [[autumn|autumn/fall]] month in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. In each [[hemisphere]], it is the [[season]]al equivalent of [[October]] in the other.

It is unclear as to where April got its name. A common theory is that it comes from the [[Latin]] word &quot;aperire&quot;, meaning &quot;to open&quot;, referring to [[flower]]s opening in [[spring]]. Another theory is that the name could come from [[Aphrodite]], the Greek goddess of [[love]]. It was originally the second month in the old Roman [[Calendar]], before the start of the new year was put to [[January 1]].

Quite a few festivals are held in this month. In many [[Southeast Asia]]n cultures, new year is celebrated in this month. In Western [[Christianity]], [[Easter]] can be celebrated on a [[Sunday]] between [[March 22]] and [[April 25]]. In [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Christianity, it can fall between [[April 4]] and [[May 8]]. At the end of the month, Central and Northern [[Europe]]an [[culture]]s celebrate [[Walpurgis Night]] on [[April 30]], marking the transition from [[winter]] into [[summer]].

== April in poetry ==
[[poetry|Poets]] use ''April'' to mean the end of winter. For example: ''April showers bring [[May]] flowers.''

'''August''' is the eighth [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]], coming between [[July]] and [[September]]. It has 31 [[day]]s, the same number of days as the previous month, [[July]], and is named after Roman Emperor [[Augustus Caesar]].

== The Month ==
[[File:Hw-augustus.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Roman Emperor [[Augustus Caesar]], after whom August is named]]
This month was first called ''[[Sextilis]]'' in [[Latin]], because it was the sixth month in the old [[Roman calendar]]. The Roman calendar began in March about 735 BC with [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]]. [[October]] was the eighth month. August was the eighth month when January or February were added to the start of the year by King [[Numa Pompilius]] about 700 BC. Or, when those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the [[decemvirs]] about 450 BC (Roman writers disagree). In [[153 BC]] [[January 1]] was determined as the beginning of the year.

August is named for [[Augustus Caesar]] who became [[Roman consul]] in this month.&lt;ref name=&quot;infoplease&quot;&gt;{{Citation |title=History of August |url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/history-of-august.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The month has 31 days because [[Julius Caesar]] added two days when he created the [[Julian calendar]] in [[45 BC]]. August is after July and before September.

August, in either [[hemisphere]], is the seasonal equivalent of [[February]] in the other. In the [[Northern hemisphere]] it is a [[summer]] month and it is a [[winter]] month in the [[Southern hemisphere]]. In a [[common year]], no other month begins on the same day of the week as August, though in [[leap year]]s, [[February]] starts on the same day as August. August always ends on the same day of the week as [[November]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Chemin montant dans les hautes herbes.png|thumb|300px|A painting by [[Renoir]] which is a work of art.]]

'''Art''' is an activity or creation by people that has importance because of an attraction to the human [[senses]]. Art is made when a human expresses himself or herself. Some art is useful in a practical sense, such as a sculptured clay [[bowl]] that one can put things in. Many people disagree on how to define art. Many people say people are driven to make art due to their inner [[creativity]]. Art includes [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[sculpting]], [[photography]], [[Performing arts|performance art]], [[dance]], [[music]], [[poetry]], [[prose]] and [[theatre]].

== Types of art ==
Art is divided into the [[plastic arts]], where something is made, and the [[performing arts]], where something is done by humans in action. The other division is between pure arts, done for themselves, and practical arts, done for a practical purpose, but with artistic content.
*Plastic arts
**Fine art is expression by making something [[Beauty|beautiful]] or appealing to the [[emotion]]s by visual means: [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[printmaking]] [[sculpture]]
**Literature: [[poetry]], creative [[writing]]
*Performing arts
**Performing Art including [[drama]] are (expression using the body: [[dance]], [[acting]], [[singing]]
**Auditory art (expression by making [[sound]]s): [[music]], [[singing]]
*Practical arts
** Culinary art (expression by making [[flavor]]s and [[taste]]s): [[cooking]] 
** The practical Arts (expression by making things and structures: [[architecture]], [[Movie|filming]], [[fashion]], [[photography]], [[video games]]

== What &quot;Art&quot; Means ==
Some people say that art is a product or item that is made with the intention of stimulating the human senses as well as the human mind or spirit.

An artwork is normally judged by how much impact it has on people, the amount of people who can relate to it, and how much people appreciate it. 

The first and broadest sense of &quot;art&quot; means &quot;arrangement&quot; or &quot;to arrange.&quot; In this sense, art is created when someone arranges things found in the world into a new or different design or form; or when someone arranges colors next to each other in a painting to make an image or just to make a pretty or interesting design.

Art can also be a form of expression of emotion. The artist may feel a certain emotion and feels there is no other way to express it than to create something that means something to them. Most of the art created in this case is made for the artist rather than an audience. Though if an audience is able to connect with the emotion as well, then the art work will become publicly successful.

== History of art ==

There are sculptures, [[cave painting]] and [[rock art]] dating from the Upper [[Paleolithic]] era. 

All of the great ancient civilizations, such as Ancient [[Egypt]], [[India]], [[China]], [[Greece]], [[Rome]] or [[Arabia]] had works and styles of art. In the [[Middle Ages]], most of the art in [[Europe]] showed people from the [[Bible]] in [[painting]]s, [[stained glass]] windows, and [[mosaic]] tile floors and walls.

[[Islamic]] art includes [[geometric]] patterns, Islamic [[calligraphy]], and [[architecture]]. In [[India]] and [[Tibet]], painted sculptures, dance, and religious painting were done. In China, arts included [[jade]] carving, bronzework, [[pottery]], [[poetry]], calligraphy, music, painting, drama, and fiction. There are many Chinese artistic styles, which are usually named after the ruling dynasty. 

In Europe, after the [[Middle Ages]], there was a &quot;[[Renaissance]]&quot; which means &quot;rebirth&quot;. People rediscovered [[science]] and artists were allowed to paint subjects other than religious subjects. People like [[Michelangelo]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] still painted religious pictures, but they also now could paint mythological pictures too. These artists also invented [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] where things in the distance look smaller than things close up in the picture. This was new because in the Middle Ages people would paint all the figures close up and just overlapping each other. 

In the late 1800s, artists in Europe, responding to [[Industrialization|Modernity]] created many new painting styles such as [[Classicism]], [[Romanticism]], [[Realism]], and [[Impressionism]]. The history of twentieth century art includes [[Expressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dada]]ism, and [[Surrealism]], and [[Minimalism]], Child-like-ism.

== Roles of art ==

In some [[society|societies]], people think that art belongs to the person who made it, such as Indigenous Aboriginal Australian Art. They think that the artist put his or her &quot;[[talent]]&quot; into the art. In this view, the art is the [[property]] of the artist. 

In other societies, people think that art belongs to no one. They think that society has put its [[social capital]] into the artist and the artist's work. In this view, society is a [[collective]] that has made the art, through the artist.

=== Functions of art ===

The [[wikt:simple:function|functions]] of art include&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bagdasaryan |first=Nadejda |title=Culturology |year=2000 |language=Russian |ISBN=5-06-003475-5 |pages=511 |chapter=7. Art as a phenomenon of culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

1) Cognitive Function

:Works of art let us know about what the author knew, and about what the surrounding of the author were like.

2) Aesthetic Function

:Works of art are more or less harmonic and bring pleasure, a sensation of beauty.

3) Prognostic Function

:Some artists draw what they see the future like, and some of them are right, but most are not...

4) Recreation Function

:Art makes us think about it, not about reality; we have a rest.

5) Value Function

:What did the artist value? What aims did he like/dislike in human activity? This usually is clearly seen in artists' works.

6) Didactic Function

:What message, criticism or political change did the artist wish to achieve?

: ''This page is about the first [[letter]] in the [[alphabet]].
: ''For the indefinite article, see [[Article (grammar)]].''
: ''For other uses of A, see [[A (disambiguation)]]''

{{A-Z}}
[[File:A cursiva.gif|thumb]]
'''A''' is the first letter of the [[English language|English]] [[alphabet]]. The small letter, '''a''', is used as a lower case [[vowel]]. However, the English long '''a''' (ā) is said as a [[diphthong]] of ĕ and y. The same letter of the [[Greek alphabet]] is named [[alpha (letter)|alpha]]. Alpha and [[omega (letter)|omega]], the last letter of the Greek alphabet, means the beginning and the end. In [[musical notation]], the letter A is the symbol of a note in the scale, below [[B]] and above [[G]]. In [[binary]] numbers, the letter A is 01000001.

A is the letter that was used to represent a team in an old [[TV]] show, [[The A-Team]].

==Where it came from==
The earliest the letter 'A' has appeared was in the Phoenician alphabet's [[aleph]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; This symbol came from a simple picture of an [[ox]] head. 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- style=&quot;background-color:#EEEEEE; text-align:center;&quot;
! Egyptian
! Phoenician &lt;br&gt;''[[aleph]]''
! Greek &lt;br&gt;''[[Alpha (letter)|Alpha]]''
! Etruscan &lt;br&gt;A
! Roman/Cyrillic &lt;br&gt;A
|- style=&quot;background-color:white; text-align:center;&quot;
|[[File:EgyptianA-01.svg|Egyptian hieroglyphic ox head]]
|[[File:PhoenicianA-01.svg|Phoenician aleph]]
|[[File:Alpha uc lc.svg|65px|Greek alpha]]
|[[File:EtruscanA.svg|Etruscan A]]
|[[File:RomanA-01.svg|Roman A]]
|}

This Phoenician letter helped make the basic blocks of later types of the letter. The Greeks later modified this letter and used it as their letter [[Alpha (letter)|alpha]]. The Greek alphabet was used by the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] in nothern Italy, and the Romans later modified the Etruscan alphabet for their own language.

==Using the letter==
The letter A has six different sounds. It can sound like æ, in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], such as the word ''pad''. Other sounds of this letter are in the words ''father'', which developed into another sound, such as in the word ''ace''.

==Use in mathematics==
In algebra, the letter &quot;A&quot; along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities.

In geometry, capital A, B, C etc. are used to label [[line segment]]s, [[Line (geomotry)|lines]], etc. Also, A is typically used as one of the letters to label an angle in a triangle

[[Image:Kawasaki-Electric Fan.jpg|thumb|A [[wikt:fan|fan]] is used to move air.]]
'''Air''' is the [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]]. It is the clear [[gas]] in which living things live and [[breathe]]. It has an indefinite shape and volume. It has no [[color]] or [[odor|smell]]. It has [[mass]] and [[weight]]. It is a [[matter]] as it has mass and weight. Air creates [[atmosphere pressure]]. There is no air in the [[vacuum]] and [[cosmos]]. 

Air is a [[mixture]] of 78.03% [[nitrogen]], 20.99% [[oxygen]], 0.94% [[argon]], 0.03% [[carbon dioxide]], 0.01% [[hydrogen]], 0.00123% [[Neon]], 0.0004% [[helium]], 0.00005% [[krypton]] and 0.000006% [[xenon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://mistupid.com/chemistry/aircomp.htm|title=composition of air}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also small amounts of other things.

Animals and humans need the [[oxygen]] in the air to live. In the [[human body]], the [[lung]]s give oxygen to the [[blood]], and give back [[carbon dioxide]] to the air. Plants need the carbon dioxide in the air to live. They give off oxygen that humans can breathe again.  

[[Wind]] is moving air.  Air [[air pollution|can be polluted]] by some gases (such as [[ozone]] and [[carbon monoxide]]), [[smoke]], and [[ash]]. Some believe that this [[pollution]] may be one of the [[cause]]s of [[global warming]].

Aircraft use [[propeller]]s to move air over a [[wing]], which allows them to [[flight|fly]].

[[File:Wikipedia Administrator.svg|thumbnail|This is the symbol of a Wikipedia administrator. It shows the site's logo with a [[mop]], as administrators are often linked to [[janitor]]s.]]
'''Administrators''', also called '''admins''' or '''sysops''' ('''sys'''tem '''op'''erators), are users who can use special [[Special:ListGroupRights/Admin|tools]] that help keep Wikipedia running smoothly.  They can use these tools because they are trusted by the community, but this does not make them better or more important than anybody else.  The opinion of an administrator, for example, should not be counted as more important than the opinion of a person who chooses to change Wikipedia with an IP address just because they have administrator rights.

''There are currently {{NUMBEROFADMINS}} administrators.''

=== Administrative tools ===
==== Delete ====
They can [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|delete]] and undelete pages. Pages can be deleted because of a [[WP:RFD|request for deletion]] or they can be [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Quick deletion|quickly deleted]] under policy. Undeletion requests should be made at [[Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion]].

=====Revision Delete=====
Administrators can also hide [[Help:Diff|revisions]] of a page from public view by deleting them. Only other administrators can see the deleted revisions. Revisions should only be hidden in special cases, listed [[Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Revision deletion|here]].

==== Protect ====
They can [[Wikipedia:Protection policy|protect]], unprotect and change protected pages, including those in the [[:en:Wikipedia:MediaWiki namespace|MediaWiki namespace]], and other users' personal [[Javascript]] or [[CSS]] (.js or .css) files.
* Requests for protection can be made at [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard]]. Please remember that pages are usually protected when there is [[WP:VAND|vandalism]] or an [[WP:edit war|edit war]] happening, and not to prevent vandalism that has not happened.

==== Block ====
They can [[Wikipedia:Blocks and bans|block]] and unblock users who are causing trouble.
* Requests should be made at [[Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress]] but only if the user has been disruptive.  Requests made in [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith|bad faith]] may result in you yourself being blocked. Blocks are different to bans.

==== Rollback ====
They can [[Wikipedia:Rollback|rollback changes]]. This lets them quickly undo all the changes by a user to a page if they are the newest changes. The change is automatically marked as a [[Help:small change|small change]] and gives the following [[WP:Change summary|change summary]]:

:'''m''' ''Reverted edits by '''User A''' ('''talk''') to last version by '''User B'''

To use bot rollback, you type in the URL &lt;nowiki&gt;http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Example&amp;bot=1  &lt;/nowiki&gt; replacing Example with the user name, and then you can rollback changes and hide them from the recent changes along with the rolled back edit, but this should only be used for large amounts of vandalism, like with a [[:m:vandalbot|vandalbot]].
* Users can also be given the rollback tool. You can make requests at [[WP:RFRB|requests for rollback]].

==== Import pages ====
They can [[meta:Import|import]] pages from other Wikipedias.

==== View unwatched pages ====
They can see which pages are not on someone's watchlist.

==== Manage userrights ====
They can give some user rights to others. They can add or remove rollback, IP block exempt, the flood flag and the patroller right for all accounts.

== Bureaucrat ==
{{shortcut|[[WP:CRAT]]&lt;br&gt;[[WP:BUR]]}}
A '''bureaucrat''' can do a few more things than an administrator, but they should only use these while acting on [[WP:CON|consensus]]. Bureaucrats can give administrator or bureaucrat rights to other users, following a successful request on [[Wikipedia:Requests for permissions]]. On the Simple English Wikipedia bureaucrats can also remove administrator status following a successful request for removal of rights (deadminship), or in certain emergency situations for protection of the wiki. They can also &quot;flag&quot; and un-flag [[Wikipedia:Bot|bots]], which means to hide their contributions from the new changes and put them in the bot group. Bureaucrats can also help users who want to [[:meta:Changing username|change their username]]. Requests for name changes should be made directly to the talk page of one of the listed bureaucrats, or on [[Wikipedia:Changing username]].

== CheckUser ==
A select few administrators have checkuser access. They can see the [[IP address]]es of named editors. They can also see which users edit from certain IP addresses, as well as some information on the [[browser]] used for editing. There are many rules as to who can become a CheckUser, and how CheckUsers have to behave. These rules are listed on the [[m:CheckUser policy|CheckUser policy]] page. CheckUsers can help fight [[vandalism]] and [[WP:Sock puppetry|sock puppetry]] this way. CheckUser requests can be made at [[Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser]].

== Oversighter ==
Certain administrators have oversighter access. Page [[:en:Help:Diff|revisions]] can be hidden or removed from the public history so they can only be seen by other oversighters and [[:m:System administrators|developers]]. The right is a sensitive one, and removes private data that can cause legal problems. There are many rules as to who can become an oversighter, and how oversighters have to behave. These rules are listed on the [[m:Oversight|Oversighter policy]] page. Oversighters can help fight [[wp:VAN|vandalism]] this way. Oversighter requests should only be made privately, and not on Wikipedia. See the [[WP:OS|Oversighter]] page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Spain]] is divided in 17 parts called '''autonomous communities'''. ''Autonomous'' means that each of these autonomous communities has its own Executive Power, its own Legislative Power and its own Judicial Power. These are similar, but NOT the same, to states in the United States of America, for example.

Spain has fifty smaller parts called provinces. In [[1978]] these parts came together, making the autonomous communities. 
Before then, some of these provinces were together but were broken. The groups that were together once before are called &quot;historic communities&quot;: Catalonia, Basque Country, Galicia and Andalusia.

The Spanish language is the official language in every autonomous commmunity but six, which also have other official languages:
* [[Catalonia]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Occitan language|Occitan]])
* [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencian Community]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]], also called [[Valencian language|Valencian]] there)
* [[Balearic Islands]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]])
* [[Galicia]] ([[Galician language|Galician]])
* [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] ([[Basque language|Basque]])
* [[Navarre]] ([[basque language|Basque]], but only in the north)

List of the autonomous communities, with their Capital city (the place where the government has its offices):

* [[Andalusia]] (its capital is [[Sevilla]])
* [[Aragon]] (its capital is [[Zaragoza]])
* [[Asturias]] (its capital is [[Oviedo]])
* [[Balearic Islands]] (its capital is [[Palma de Mallorca]])
* [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] (its capital is [[Vitoria]])
* [[Canary Islands]] (they have two capitals - [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] and [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]])
* [[Cantabria]] (its capital is [[Santander]])
* [[Castile-La Mancha]] (its capital is [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]])
* [[Castile and León]] (its capital is [[Valladolid]])
* [[Catalonia]] (its capital is [[Barcelona]])
* [[Extremadura]] (its capital is [[Mérida]])
* [[Galicia]] (its capital is [[Santiago de Compostela]])
* [[La Rioja]] (its capital is [[Logroño]])
* [[Community of Madrid]] (its capital is [[Madrid]])
* [[Region of Murcia]] (its capital is [[Murcia]])
* [[Navarre]] (its capital is [[Pamplona]])
* [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencian Community]] (its capital is [[Valencia]])

Spain also has two cities on the north coast of Africa: [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]. They are called &quot;autonomous cities&quot; and have simultaneously the majority of the power of an autonomous community and also power of provinces and power of municipalities.

'''Alan Mathison Turing''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] [[FRS]] ([[London]], 23 June 1912 – [[Wilmslow]], [[Cheshire]], 7 June 1954) was an [[English people|English]] [[mathematician]] and [[computer scientist]], born in [[Maida Vale]], London.&lt;ref&gt;Newman M.H.A. 1955. Alan Mathison Turing. 1912–1954. ''Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society'' '''1''': 253. [http://rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/253]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
He was one of the people who worked on the first [[computers]]. He was the first person to think of using a computer to do things that were too hard for a person to do. He created the [[Turing machine]] in 1936. The machine was [[Imagination|imaginary]], but it included the idea of a [[Computer program|program]]. 

Turing was interested in [[artificial intelligence]]. He proposed the [[Turing test]], to say when a machine could be called &quot;intelligent&quot;. A computer could be said to &quot;think&quot; if a human interrogator could not tell it apart, through conversation, from a human being.&lt;ref&gt;Harnad, Stevan 2008.  [http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/7741 The Annotation game: Turing (1950) on Computing, machinery and intelligence]. In: Epstein, Robert &amp; Peters, Grace (eds) ''Parsing the Turing Test: philosophical and methodological issues in the quest for the thinking computer''. Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Turing worked to break [[Germany|German]] [[cipher]]s (secret messages). Using [[cryptanalysis]] he helped to break the [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] machine. After that, he solved other German signals.

From 1945 to 1947 Turing worked on the design of the [[ACE (computer)|ACE]] (Automatic Computing Engine) at the [[National Physical Laboratory]]. He presented a paper on 19 February 1946, which was ''the first detailed design of a [[stored-program computer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, B. Jack 2006. ''Colossus: The secrets of Bletchley Park's code-breaking computers''. Oxford University Press. p108 ISBN 978-0-19-284055-4&lt;/ref&gt; Although ACE was a feasible design, the secrecy surrounding the wartime work at [[Bletchley Park]] led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year. While he was at Cambridge, the [[Pilot ACE]] was built in his absence. It executed its first program on 10&amp;nbsp;May 1950.

== Private life ==
Turing was a [[gay]] man. In 1952, Turing admitted having had sex with a man in [[England]]. At that time, it was a crime to take part in [[homosexual]] acts. He was convicted and forced to make a choice. He could choose between going to [[jail]] or take [[hormone]]s like [[oestrogen]] to lower his sex drive. He decided to take the hormones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Letters of Note: Yours in distress, Alan |last=Turing |first=Alan |year=1952 |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/yours-in-distress-alan.html |archivedate=December 16, 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CxLiSeL9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his punishment, he became impotent and could not get an [[erection]]. He also grew [[breast]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Alan Turing: The Enigma The Centenary Edition | publisher=Princeton University | author=Andrew Hodges | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, a [[private member's bill]] was put before the [[House of Lords]] to grant Turing a statutory [[pardon]].&lt;ref name=Guardian-Pardon&gt;{{cite web|title=Parliamentary bill launched for Alan Turing pardon|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/jul/25/alan-turing-private-members-bill-lord-sharkey|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013 it gained government support&lt;ref name=turingguardian19july2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk-news/2013/jul/19/enigma-codebreaker-alan-turing-posthumous-pardon|title=Enigma codebreaker Alan Turing to be given posthumous pardon|publisher=The Guardian|date=19 July 2013|author=Nicholas Watt}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[royal prerogative of mercy]] was granted on 24&lt;!-- Mercy is effective from 24 December although it was announced on the night of 23rd --&gt; December 2013.&lt;ref name=turingindependent24dec2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/alan-turing-gets-his-royal-pardon-for-gross-indecency--61-years-after-he-poisoned-himself-9023116.html|title=Alan Turing gets his royal pardon for 'gross indecency' – 61 years after he poisoned himself|publisher=The Independent|date=23 December 2013|Author=Oliver Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=turingpardoncryptome24dec2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cryptome.org/2013/12/turing-pardon.pdf|title=(Archived copy of) Royal Pardon for Alan Turing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
In 1954, after suffering for two years, he died either after eating an [[apple]] which was poisoned with [[cyanide]], or by drinking the cyanide in water. The reason for the confusion is that the police never tested the apple for cyanide.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, Andrew 1983. ''Alan Turing: the enigma''. London: Burnett Books, p488. ISBN 0-04-510060-8&lt;/ref&gt; 

The treatment forced on him is now believed to be very wrong, going against [[medical ethics]] and international laws of [[human rights]]. In August 2009, a [[petition]] asking the [[British Government]] to apologise to Turing for punishing him for being a homosexual was started.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thousands call for Turing apology |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8226509.stm |publisher=BBC News  |date=31&amp;nbsp;August 2009 |accessdate=31 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Petition seeks apology for Enigma code-breaker Turing | url = http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/09/01/alan.turing.petition/index.html | publisher=CNN | date = 01&amp;nbsp;September 2009 | accessdate =1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition received thousands of signatures.&lt;ref&gt;The petition was only open to UK citizens.&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] acknowledged the petition, and called Turing's treatment &quot;appalling&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = PM's apology to codebreaker Alan Turing: we were inhumane | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/11/pm-apology-to-alan-turing | publisher=The Guardian| date = 11 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alanis Nadine Morissette''' (born 1 June 1974) is a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]]-winning [[Canada|Canadian]]-[[Americans|American]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ([http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/alanismorissette/articles/story/7000077/in_brief_alanis_jlo &quot;In Brief: Alanis, J.Lo: Alanis gets American citizenship, J.Lo loses European tour&quot;]), [[16 February]] [[2005]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[singer]] and [[songwriter]]. She was born in [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]]. She began singing in Canada as a teenager in [[1990]]. In [[1995]], she became popular all over the world.

'''Andouille''' is a type of [[pork]] [[sausage]]. It is spicy (hot in taste) and smoked. There are different kinds, all with different combinations of pork [[meat]], [[fat]], [[intestines]] (tubes going to the [[stomach]]), and [[tripe]] (the wall of the stomach). Andouille sausage first came from [[France]] or [[Germany]] (no-one is sure), but the name indicates that it may have come out from France, and the most famous sort in the [[United States|USA]] is the &quot;Cajun&quot; style. 

Other sorts are &quot;French andouille&quot; and &quot;German andouille&quot;; they are less spicy than Cajun. Cajun has extra [[sodium chloride|salt]], [[black pepper]], and [[garlic]]. Andouille makers smoke the sausages over pecan wood and sugar cane for a maximum of seven or eight hours, at about 175 degrees Fahrenheit (80 degrees Celsius).

'''Farming''' is growing [[crop]]s or keeping animals by people for [[food]] and [[raw material]]s. Farming is a part of [[agriculture]].

== History ==
Agriculture started at least 10,000 years ago, but no one knows for sure how old it is.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Tudge argues &quot;from at least 40,000 years ago... people were managing their environment to such an extent that they can properly be called 'proto-farmers'&quot;. Tudge, Colin 1998. ''Neanderthals, bandits and farmers: how agriculture really began''. London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, p3. ISBN 0-297-84256-7&lt;/ref&gt; The development of farming gave rise to the [[Neolithic Revolution]] whereby people gave up [[nomad]]ic [[hunting]] and settled in what became [[cities]].

Agriculture and [[domestication]] probably started in the [[Fertile Crescent]] (the [[Nile]] Valley, The [[Levant]] and [[Mesopotamia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Harris, David (ed) 1996. ''The origins and spread of agriculture and pastoralism in [[Eurasia]]: crops, fields, flocks and herds''. UCL Press. ISBN 1-56098-675-1&lt;/ref&gt; The area called Fertile Crescent is now in the countries of [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Turkey]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], and [[Egypt]]. [[Wheat]] and [[barley]] are some of the first crops people grew. People probably started agriculture slowly by planting a few crops, but still gathered many foods from the wild. People may have started farming because the weather and soil began to change. Farming can feed many more people than [[hunter-gatherer]]s can feed on the same amount of land.

== Overview ==
Agriculture is not only growing food for people and animals, but also growing other things like [[flower]]s, [[ornamental]] plants (plants people use to improve the look of their homes) and [[nursery]] [[plant]]s (plants people buy to grow food on their own farms and land), manure or dung, [[animal hides]] (skins or furs), [[leather]], industrial chemicals ([[starch]], [[ethanol]], and [[plastic]]s), [[fiber]]s ([[cotton]], [[wool]], [[cannabis|hemp]], and [[flax]]), fuels ([[methane]], [[biodiesel]], [[biomass]]), and [[drug]]s ([[biopharmaceutical]]s, [[marijuana]], [[opium]])

Many people live by doing what is called [[subsistence agriculture]], on a small farm. Only the farmer's family lives on the farm. Subsistence agriculture is growing only enough food to feed the farmer, his family, and his animals. Extra food or animals are sold for money or other things the farmer cannot grow. The [[yield]] is the amount of food grown on a given amount of land, and the yield is often low. This is because subsistence farmers are generally less [[education|educated]], and they have less [[money]] to buy equipment. When yields are low, [[forests]] are sometimes cut to provide new land to grow more food. This is good in the [[short term]], but can be bad for the country and the surrounding environment over many years.

In rich countries, farms are often much larger. The yield on farms has gotten bigger in the last one hundred years because farmers are able to grow better [[variety (botany)|varieties]] of plants, use more fertilizer, use more water, and more easily control weeds and pests. Many farms also use machines, which cut down on the number of people needed to farm the land. This results in fewer farmers in rich countries, but the farmers are able to eat more. This kind of [[intensive agriculture]] comes with its own set of problems. Farmers use a lot of chemical fertilizers, [[pesticide]]s (chemicals that kill bugs), and [[herbicide]]s (chemicals that kill weeds). These chemicals can [[pollute]] the [[soil]] or the water. They can also create bugs and weeds that are more resistant to the chemicals, causing outbreaks of these pests. The soil can be damaged by [[erosion]] (blowing or washing away), salt buildup, or loss of structure. [[Irrigation]] (adding water from rivers) can pollute water and lower the water table. Having fewer farmers also changes society and can make a country less able to feed itself in bad times.

=== Agriculture techniques ===
* [[Fertilizer]]s
* [[Crop rotation]]
* [[Weed]] removal
* [[Breeding]]
* [[Agricultural fencing|Fencing]]
* [[Ranching]]

Farmers select plants with better yield, taste, and [[nutrition]]al value. They also choose plants that are more resistant to disease, more tolerant to drought, and easier to harvest. Centuries of careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. The crops produce better yield with other techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, irrigation).

Some companies have been searching for new plants in poor countries, and genetically modify these plants to improve them. They then try to patent the seeds and sell them back to the poor countries.

New plants were created with [[genetic engineering]]. One example of [[genetic engineering]] is modifying a plant to resist an herbicide.

== Food ==
It is important for there to be enough food for everyone. The food must also be safe and good. They say it is sometimes not safe, because it contains some chemicals. Other people say intensive agriculture is damaging the environment. For this reason, there are several types of agriculture.

Traditional agriculture is mostly done in poor countries.

Intensive agriculture is mostly done in wealthier countries. It uses pesticides, machinery, chemical fertilizers. Organic farming is using only natural products. Integrated farming is using local resources, and trying to use the waste from one process as a resource in another process.

[[Agricultural policy]] focuses on the goals and methods of agricultural production. At the policy level, common goals of agriculture include:

* [[Food safety]]: to be sure that the food supply is safe.
* [[Food security]]: to be sure there is enough food for everyone.
* [[Food quality]]: to be sure the food is of good quality.

== Problems in agriculture ==
There are some serious problems that face people trying to grow food today.
These include:
* [[Erosion]]
* [[Diseases]]
* [[Pests]]
* [[Weed]]s
* [[Drought]]
* [[Rainfall]]

== Crops ==
The major crops produced in the world in 2002, are maize (corn), wheat, rice, and cotton.

*[[Maize]] 624 millions of metric tons
*[[Wheat]] 570 millions of metric tons
*[[Rice]] 381.1 millions of metric tons
*[[Cotton]] 96.5 millions of metric tons

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Arithmetic''' is a name for working with [[number]]s. It is a part of [[mathematics]]. The four basic arithmetic operations are [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], and [[Division (mathematics)|division]].

Harder arithmetic includes working with [[signed number]]s, [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], and [[decimal]]s, and taking [[power (math)|powers]] and [[root (math)|roots]].

Most people learn arithmetic in [[primary school]], but some people do not learn arithmetic and others forget the arithmetic they learned. Many jobs require a knowledge of arithmetic, and many employers complain that it is hard to find people who know enough arithmetic. A few of the many jobs that require arithmetic include [[carpenter]]s, [[plumber]]s, [[automobile mechanic|auto mechanics]], [[accountant]]s, [[architect]]s, [[Medical doctor|doctors]], and [[nurse]]s. Arithmetic is needed in all areas of mathematics, [[science]], and [[engineering]]. 

A [[calculator]] can be used to do arithmetic.

== Examples of arithmetic ==

* 2 + 3 = 5 (adding is [[commutative property|commutative]]: 2 + 3 is the same as 3 + 2)

* 7 - 5 = 2 (subtracting is not commutative: 7 - 5 is different from 5 - 7)

* 3 * 4 = 12 (multiplying is commutative: 3 * 4 is the same as 4 * 3)

* 6 / 2 = 3 (dividing is not commutative: 6 / 2 is different from 2 / 6)

'''Addition''' is the [[mathematics|mathematical]] way of putting things together.

== Arithmetic ==

In [[arithmetic]], addition is finding the total of two or more [[number]]s. The sign for addition is &quot;+&quot;. The name for the sign &quot;+&quot; is &quot;plus&quot;.  
Another name for the total is the [[sum]].

=== Counting examples ===
For example, there are [[wikt:object|objects]] in two [[group]]s. The objects are small circles: &quot;o&quot;. One group has five of these objects. The other group has 3 of these objects. To find the total number of objects in both groups, the objects can be counted. Another way to find the number of objects in both groups is to add the numbers in each group.  

====Adding====

Another method is to add the numbers of objects in group A and group B, since they are already counted. In symbols:

:{{math|5 + 3}}

There are [[rule]]s for adding numbers that people [[learn]]. There are also rules for adding numbers that are built into machines ([[binary adder]]). The rule says that:

:{{math|{{aao|5|3|+}}}}

In another counting example, Sally and Bill have 2 children. Sally and Bill get 3 more children. Sally and Bill have added three children to their two children and now have five children.

'''Vertical Addition'''

The animation above demonstrates the addition of seven hundred and eighty six and four hundred and sixty seven, the problems digits have been separated into units, tens and hundreds ([[place value]]).  First the units 6 and 7 are added together to make 13, so 1 ten and 3 units, the 3 is written below and the 1 ten is carried to the tens column. Next in the tens column the 1, 8 and 6 are added together to make 15 tens, so 1 hundred and 5 tens, the 5 is written below and the 1 hundred is carried to the hundreds column. Finally in the hundreds column 1, 7 and 4 are added together to make 12 hundreds, so 1 thousand and 2 hundreds, the 2 is written below and the 1 thousand is carried to the thousand column. Giving the answer one thousand two hundred and fifty three.

===A measurement example===
Tom wants to know the distance between his house and Sally's house. Bob's house is 300 meters  east of Tom's house. Sally's house is 120 meters east of Bob's house:

:Tom's house&lt;------------300 meters--------------&gt;Bob's house&lt;-----120 meters-----&gt;Sally's house

The distance from Tom's house to Sally's house can be found by adding the distances already measured. The distance from Tom's house to Bob's house added to the distance from Bob's house to Sally's house is the same as the distance from Tom's house to Sally's house. That is, three hundred (300) meters plus 120 meters.

== Addition as increase ==
Addition can also mean to make bigger.

=== Example of addition as increase ===
* For example, Tom has a house. Tom puts a new room on the house. This new room is called an addition.

* John is making [[food]]. To make the food [[taste]] better, John puts [[salt]] in the food. That is, John adds salt to the food. The [[salt]] is a [[food additive]] or addition to the food.

'''Australia''' is an [[Oceania]]n [[country]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] between the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the [[Indian Ocean]].  Its official name is the '''Commonwealth of Australia'''. Australia is the sixth biggest country in the world by landmass. The Australian [[emblem]] is a flower called the Golden Wattle. 

23-24 million people live in Australia, and about 80% of them live on the east coast. About 60% live in and around the mainland state capitals of [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and [[Adelaide]]. Australia's capital city is [[Canberra]].

Australia, [[New Zealand]], [[New Guinea]] and other islands on the Australian [[tectonic plate]] are together called [[Australasia]]. They form one of the world's great [[ecozone]]s. When other Pacific islands are included, the term is [[Oceania]].

== Geography ==
[[File:As-map.png|thumbnail|left|Map of Australia]]
Australia's landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometers is on the Indo-Australian plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Turner | first=Kate | year=2008 | title=National Geographic Australia | publisher=Horupu | location=Tokyo | page=pp.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The continent of Australia, including the island of Tasmania, was separated from the other continents of the world many millions of years ago. Because of this, many [[animals]] and [[plants]] live in Australia that do not live anywhere else. These include animals like the [[kangaroo]], the [[koala]], the [[emu]], the [[kookaburra]], and the [[platypus]].

People first arrived in Australia more than 50,000 years ago. These native Australians are called the [[Australian Aborigine]]s. For the history of Australia, see [[History of Australia]].

Most of the Australian colonies, having been settled from [[Britain]], became mostly independent democratic states in the 1850s and all six combined as a federation on [[1 January]] [[1901]]. The first [[Prime Minister of Australia]] was [[Edmund Barton]] in [[1901]]. Australia is a member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It is a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[Queen Elizabeth II|Elizabeth II]] as Queen of Australia and Head of State and a [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] who is chosen by the Prime Minister to carry out all the duties of the Queen in Australia.

=== Regions and cities ===
{{Other pages|List of Cities in Australia}}
Australia has six states, two major mainland territories, and other minor territories. The states are [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Cummins | first=Brian R. | year=1990 | title=Australia | publisher= the Australian Government Publishing Service | location=Canberra | pages= 16-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two major mainland territories are the [[Northern Territory]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT).

In July [[2007]] Australia had just over 21 million people. Most Australians live in cities along the coast, such as [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Darwin, Australia|Darwin]], [[Hobart]] and [[Adelaide]]. The largest inland city is [[Canberra]], which is also the nation's capital. The largest city is Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Oceania South Pole | author= Tanabe Yu | year= 1997 | publisher= Asakura Bookstore | location= Shinjyuku ward | page= 3179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia is a very big country, but much of the land is very dry, and the middle of the continent is mostly [[desert]]. Only the areas around the east, west and south coast have enough rain and a suitable [[climate]] (not too hot) for many [[farm]]s and [[cities]].

== History ==
=== Aboriginal people ===
[[File:Corroboree.jpg|thumb|Photograph of Arrernte men of Central Australia in a [[Corroboree]] in 1900.]]

The [[Australian Aborigine|Australian Aboriginal]] people arrived in Australia more than 50,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The history of Australia |author=Takao Fujikawa |year=2004|publisher=Yuhikaku ARMA |location=Tokyo |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the arrival of British settlers in 1788, the Aboriginal people lived by hunting and gathering food from the land. They lived in all sorts of climates and managed the land in different ways. An example of Aboriginal land management was the Cumberland Plain where Sydney is now. Every few years the Aboriginal people would burn the grass and small trees.{{Citation}} This meant that a lot of grass grew back, but not many big trees. Kangaroos like to live on grassy plains, but not in forests. The kangaroos that lived on the plain were a good food supply for the Aboriginal people. Sometimes, Aborigines would name a person after an animal, and they could not eat that animal to help level out the food population.

Aboriginal people did not usually build houses, except huts of grass, leaves and bark. They did not usually build walls or fences, and there were no horses, cows or sheep in Australia that needed to be kept in pens. The only Aboriginal buildings that are known are fish-traps made from stones piled up in the river, and the remains of a few stone huts in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]].{{Citation}} The Aboriginal people did not use metal or make pottery or use bows and arrows or weave cloth. In some parts of Australia the people used sharp flaked-stone spearheads, but most Aboriginal spears were made of sharply pointed wood. Australia has a lot of trees that have very hard wood that was good for spear making. The [[boomerang]] was used in some areas for sport and for hunting.

The Aboriginal people did not think that the land belonged to them. They believed that they had grown from the land, so it was like their mother, and they belonged to the land.

=== Terra Australis ===
In the 1600s, [[Dutch people|Dutch]] merchants traded with the islands of [[Batavia]] (now [[Indonesia]]), to the north of Australia and several different Dutch ships touched on the coast of Australia. The Dutch Governor, van Diemen, sent [[Abel Tasman]] on a voyage of discovery and he found [[Tasmania]], which he named [[Van Diemen's Land]]. Its name was later changed to honour the man who discovered it.

The [[British Government]] were sure that there must be a very large land in the south, that had not been explored. They sent Captain [[James Cook]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. His ship, ''[[HMS Endeavour]]'', carried the famous scientists, Sir [[Joseph Banks]] and Dr Solander who were going to [[Tahiti]] where they would watch the planet [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] pass in front of the [[Sun]]. Captain Cook's secret mission was to find &quot;Terra Australis&quot; (the Land of the South).

The voyage of discovery was very successful, because they found [[New Zealand]] and sailed right around it. Then they sailed westward. At last, a boy, William Hicks, who was up the mast spotted land on the [[horizon]]. Captain Cook named that bit of land [[Point Hicks]]. They sailed up the coast and Captain Cook named the land that he saw &quot;New South Wales&quot;. At last they sailed into a large open bay which was full of fish and stingrays which the sailors speared for food. Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander went ashore and were astonished to find that they did not know what any of the plants or birds or animals that they saw were. They collected hundreds of plants to take back to England.

Captain Cook saw the Aboriginal people with their simple way of life. He saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit. But there were no houses and no fences. In most parts of the world, people put up a house and a fence or some marker to show that they own the land. But the Aboriginal people did not own the land in that way. They belonged to the land, like a baby belongs to its mother. Captain Cook went home to England and told the Government that no-one owned the land. This would later cause a terrible problem for the Aboriginal people.

=== Settlement ===
[[File:The Founding of Australia. By Capt. Arthur Phillip R.N. Sydney Cove, Jan. 26th 1788.jpg|thumb|Captain [[Arthur Phillip]] raises the British flag at [[Sydney]] in 1788.]]

In the 1700s, in England, laws were tough, many people were poor and [[gaol]]s ([[jail]]s) were full. A person could be sentenced to death for stealing a loaf of bread. Many people were hanged for small crimes. But usually they were just thrown in gaol. Often they were sent away to the British Colonies in America. But in the 1770s, the colonies in America became the United States. They were free from British rule and would not take England's convicts any more.

By the 1780s the gaols of England were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships. The Government decided to make a settlement in New South Wales and send some of the convicts there. In 1788 the [[First Fleet]] of eleven ships set sail from [[Portsmouth]] carrying convicts, sailors, marines, a few free settlers and enough food to last for two years. Their leader was Captain [[Arthur Phillip]]. They were to make a new colony at the place that Captain Cook had discovered, named Botany Bay because of all the unknown plants found there by the two scientists.

Captain Phillip found that [[Botany Bay]] was flat and windy. There was not much fresh water. He went with two ships up the coast and sailed into a great harbour which he said was &quot;the finest harbour in the world!&quot; There were many small bays on the harbour so he decided on one which had a good stream of fresh water and some flat shore to land on. On the 26th January, [[1788]], the flag was raised and New South Wales was claimed in the name of King George III of England, and the new settlement was called Sydney.

For the first few years of the settlement, things were very difficult. No-one in the British Government had thought very hard about what sort of convicts should be sent to make a new colony. Nobody had chosen them carefully. There was only one man who was a farmer. There was no-one among the convicts who was a builder, a brickmaker or a blacksmith. No-one knew how to fix the tools when they broke. The cattle all escaped. There were no cooking pots. All the plants were different so no-one knew which ones could be eaten. There was a grave danger that everyone in the new colony would die of starvation.

Somehow, the little group of tents with a hut for the Governor, Arthur Phillip, and another hut for the supply of food, grew into a small town with streets, a bridge over the stream, a windmill for grinding grain and wharves for ships. By the 1820s there was a fine brick house for the Governor. There was also a hospital and a convict barracks and a beautiful church which are still standing today. Settlements had spread out from Sydney, firstly to [[Norfolk Island]] and to [[Van Diemen's Land]] (Tasmania), and also up the coast to Newcastle, where coal was discovered, and inland where the missing cattle were found to have grown to a large herd. Spanish Merino sheep had been brought to Sydney, and by 1820, farmers were raising fat lambs for meat and also sending fine wool back to the factories of England.

While the settlement was growing in New South Wales, it was also growing in Tasmania. The climate in Tasmania was more like that in England, and farmers found it easy to grow crops there.

=== Exploration ===
[[File:Ln-Governor-Lachlan macquarie.jpg|thumb|Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] was the 5th [[Governor of New South Wales]] and one who though that Australia could be a rich and free place.]]

Because Australia is such a very large land, it was easy to think that it might be able to hold a very large number of people. In the early days of the colony, a great number of explorers went out, searching for good land to settle on.
When the settlers looked west from Sydney, they saw a range of mountains which they called the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]]. They were not very high and did not look very rugged but for many years no-one could find their way through them. In 1813 [[Gregory Blaxland]], [[William Lawson (explorer)|William Lawson]] and a 17 year-old called [[William Charles Wentworth]] crossed the Blue Mountains and found land on the other side which was good for farming. A road was built and the Governor, [[Lachlan Macquarie]] founded the town of [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] on the other side, 100&amp;nbsp;miles from Sydney.

Some people, like Captain [[Charles Sturt]] were sure that there must be a sea in the middle of Australia and set out to find it. Many of the explorers did not prepare very well, or else they went out to explore at the hottest time of year. Some died like Burke and Wills. [[Ludwig Leichhardt]] got lost twice. The second time, he was never seen again. Major [[Thomas Mitchell]] was one of the most successful explorers. He mapped the country as he went, and his maps remained in use for more than 100 years. He travelled all the way to what is now western Victoria, and to his surprise and annoyance found that he was not the first white person there. The Henty brothers had come from [[Tasmania]], had built themselves a house, had a successful farm and fed the Major and his men on roast lamb and wine.

===Self government===

The goldrushes of New South Wales and Victoria started in 1851 leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold. The population grew across south east Australia and made great wealth and industry. By 1853 the goldrushes had made some poor people, very rich.

The transportation of convicts to Australia ended in the 1840s and 1850s and more changes came. The people in Australia wanted to run their own country, and not be told what to do from London. The first governments in the colonies were run by Governors chosen by London. Soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy. [[William Wentworth]] started the Australian Patriotic Association (Australia's first political party) in 1835 to demand [[Parliamentary democracy|democratic government]]. In 1840, the city councils started and some people could vote. [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] had its first elections in 1843, again with some limits on who could vote. In 1855, limited self-government was given by London to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. In 1855, the [[right to vote]] was given to all men over 21 in [[South Australia]]. The other colonies soon followed. Women were given the vote in the [[Parliament of South Australia]] in 1895 and they became the first women in the world allowed to stand in elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;aec.gov.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/indigenous_vote/indigenous.htm |title=AEC.gov.au |publisher=AEC.gov.au |date=25 Oct. 2007 |accessdate=27 Jun. 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=8 Documenting Democracy] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/60vtMmmE7|date =2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australians had started parliamentary democracries all across the continent. But voices were getting louder for all of them to come together as one country with a national parliament.

Until 1901, Australia was not a [[nation]], it was six separate [[colony|colonies]] governed by Britain. They voted to join together to form one new country, called the Commonwealth of Australia, in 1901. Australia was still part of the British Empire, and at first wanted only British or Europeans to come to Australia. But soon it had its own money, and its own Army and Navy.

In Australia at this time, the [[trade union]]s were very strong, and they started a political party, the [[Australian Labor Party]]. Australia passed many laws to help the [[worker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/wright.htm Women and the Right to Vote in Australia - Australian Electoral Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, the [[World War I|First World War]] started in Europe. Australia joined in on the side of Britain against [[Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Turkey]]. Australian soldiers were sent to [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], in Turkey. They fought bravely, but were beaten by the Turks. Today Australia remembers this battle every year on [[ANZAC Day]]. They also fought on the [[Western Front]]. More than 60,000 Australians were killed.

Australia had a really hard time in the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s and joined Britain in a war against [[Nazi Germany]] when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939. But in 1941 lots of Australian soldiers were captured in the [[Japanese Occupation of Singapore|Fall of Singapore]] by Japan. Then Japan started attacking Australia and people worried about invasion. But with help from the [[United States Navy]], the Japanese were stopped. After the war, Australia became a close friend of the United States.

When the war ended, Australia felt that it needed many more people to fill the country up and to work. So the government said it would take in people from Europe who had lost their homes in the war. It did things like build the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]]. Over the next 25 years, millions of people came to Australia. They came especially from [[Italy]] and [[Greece]], other countries in Europe. Later they also came from countries like [[Turkey]] and [[Lebanon]]. An important new party, the [[Liberal Party (Australia)|Liberal Party of Australia]] was made by [[Robert Menzies]] in 1944 and it won lots of elections from 1949 until in 1972, then [[Gough Whitlam]] won for the Labor Party. Whitlam made changes, but he made the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] unhappy and the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] sacked him and forced an election in 1975. Then [[Malcolm Fraser]] won a few elections for the Liberal Party.

In the 1960s many people began coming to Australia from [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Malaysia]] and other countries in [[Asia]]. Australia became more [[multicultural]]. In the 1950s and 1960s Australia became one of the richest countries in the world, helped by mining and wool. Australia started trading more with America, then Japan. Australia supported the United States in wars against [[dictatorship]]s in [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] and later [[Iraq]]. Australian soldiers also helped the [[United Nations]] in countries like [[East Timor]] in 1999.

In 1973, the famous [[Sydney Opera House]] opened. In the 1970s, 80s and 90s lots of [[Australian cinema|Australian movies]], actors and [[Australian music|singers]] became famous around the world. In the year 2000, [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney had the Summer Olympics]].

In the 1980s and 90s, the Labor Party under [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Paul Keating]], then the Liberal Party under [[John Howard]] made lots of changes to the economy. Australia had a bad [[recession]] in 1991, but when other Western countries [[Global financial crisis of September–October 2008|had trouble with their economies in 2008]], Australia stayed strong.

Today Australia is a rich, peaceful and democratic country. But it still has problems. Around 4-5% of Australians could not get a job in 2010. A lot of land in Australia (like [[Uluru]]) has been returned to Aboriginal people, but lots of Aborigines are still poorer than everybody else. Every year the government chooses a big number of new people from all around the world to come as [[immigrant]]s to live in  Australia. These people may come because they want to do business, or to live in a democracy, to join their family, or because they are [[refugee]]s. Australia took 6.5 million immigrants in the 60 years after [[World War Two]], including around 660,000 refugees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html Australia in Brief: Australia - an overview - Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julia Gillard]] became the first woman [[Prime Minister of Australia]] in 2010 when she replaced her colleague [[Kevin Rudd]] of the Labor Party.

== Politics ==
[[File:Australian house of representatives04.jpg|thumb|left|The chamber of the [[Australian House of Representatives]] in [[Canberra]].]]

Australia is made up of six [[state]]s and three mainland [[wikt:territory|territories]]. Each state and territory has its own [[Parliament]] and makes its own local [[law]]s. The [[Parliament of Australia]] sits in Canberra and makes laws for the whole country, also known as the Commonwealth or [[Federation]].

The [[Federation|Federal]] government is led by the [[Prime Minister of Australia]], who is the member of Parliament chosen as leader. The current Prime Minister is [[Tony Abbott]].

The leader of Australia is the Prime Minister, although the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] represents the Queen of Australia, who is also the Queen of Great Britain, as head of state. The Governor-General, currently, Her Excellency Ms [[Quentin Bryce]], is chosen by the Prime Minister.

== Culture ==
[[File:Sydney Opera House Night.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;The [[Sydney Opera House]] was officially opened in 1973.]]

Australia was [[Colonisation|colonised]] by people from [[Britain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A New History of Australia |authors=Takao Fujikawa |year=2004 |publisher=ARMA |location=Tokyo |page=pp. 40 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but today people from all over the world live there. English is the main spoken language, and Christianity is the main religion though all religions are accepted and not everybody has a religion. Australia is [[multiculturalism|multicultural]], which means that all its people are helped to keep their different languages, religions and ways of life, while also learning [[English language|English]] and joining in with other Australians.

Famous [[Australian literature|Australian writers]] include the bush balladeers [[Banjo Paterson]] and [[Henry Lawson]] who wrote about life in the Australian bush. More modern famous writers include [[Peter Carey (novelist)|Peter Carey]], [[Thomas Keneally]] and [[Colleen McCullough]]. In 1973, [[Patrick White]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], the only Australian to have achieved this; he is seen as one of the great English-language writers of the twentieth century.

[[Australian music]] has had lots of world-wide stars, for example the opera singers [[Nellie Melba]] and [[Joan Sutherland]], the rock and roll bands [[Bee Gees]], [[AC/DC]] and [[INXS]], the folk-rocker [[Paul Kelly (musician)]], the pop singer [[Kylie Minogue]] and [[Australian country music]] stars [[Slim Dusty]] and John Williamson. [[Australian Aboriginal music]] is very special and very ancient: it has the famous [[digeridoo]] woodwind instrument. [[File:didgeridoo.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;|[[didgeridoo]]]]

Australian TV has produced many successful programs for home and overseas - including [[Skippy the Bush Kangaroo]], [[Home and Away]] and [[Neighbours]] - and produced such well known TV stars as [[Barry Humphries]] (''Dame Edna Everage''), [[Steve Irwin]] (''The Crocodile Hunter'') and [[The Wiggles]].

Australia has two public broadcasters (the ABC and the multi-cultural SBS), three commercial television networks, three pay-TV services, and numerous public, non-profit television and radio stations. Each major city has its daily newspapers, and there are two national daily newspapers, The Australian and The Australian Financial Review.

[[Australian cinema|Australian movies]] have a very long history. The world's first feature movie was the Australian movie ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'' of 1906.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/story-kelly-gang Video Overview The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906) on ASO - Australia's audio and visual heritage online]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1933, ''[[In the Wake of the Bounty]]'', directed by Charles Chauvel, had [[Errol Flynn]] as the main actor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/wake-bounty/ Video Overview In the Wake of the Bounty (1933) on ASO - Australia's audio and visual heritage online]&lt;/ref&gt; Flynn went on to a celebrated career in Hollywood. The first Australian Oscar was won by 1942's ''[[Kokoda Front Line!]]'', directed by [[Ken G. Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://aso.gov.au/titles/newsreels/kokoda-front-line/ Video Overview Kokoda Front Line! (1942) on ASO - Australia's audio and visual heritage online]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s and 1980s lots of big Australian movies and movie stars became world famous with movies like ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'', [[Gallipoli (1981 movie)|''Gallipoli'']] (with [[Mel Gibson]]), ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 movie)|The Man From Snowy River]]'' and ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwmcc.murdoch.edu.au/ReadingRoom/film/Croc.html &quot;Fair Dinkum Fillums&quot;: the Crocodile Dundee Phenomenon]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russell Crowe]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Heath Ledger]] became global stars during the 1990s and ''[[Australia (2008 movie)|Australia]]'' starring [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[Hugh Jackman]] made a lot of money in 2008.

=== Sport ===
[[File:DonaldBradman.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Don Bradman]].]]

Sport is an important part of Australian culture because the climate is good for outdoor activities. 23.5% Australians over the age of 15 regularly take part in organised sporting activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndca.asn.au/other-information/about-australia/|title=About Australia|publisher=NDCA|accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In international sports, Australia has very strong teams in [[cricket]], [[hockey]], [[netball]], [[rugby league]] and [[rugby union]], and performs well in [[cycling]], [[rowing]] and swimming. Local popular sports include [[Australian Rules Football]], horse racing, soccer and motor racing. Australia has participated in every summer [[Olympic Games]] since 1896, and every [[Commonwealth Games]]. Australia has hosted the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]] and [[2000 Summer Olympics]], and has ranked in the top five medal-winners since 2000. Australia has also hosted the 1938, 1962, 1982 and 2006 Commonwealth Games. Other major international events held regularly in Australia include the Australian Open, one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments, annual international cricket matches and the Formula One Australian Grand Prix. Corporate and government sponsorship of many sports and elite athletes is common in Australia. Televised sport is popular; some of the highest-rated television programs include the Summer Olympic Games and the grand finals of local and international football competitions.

The main sporting leagues for males are the [[Australian Football League]], [[National Rugby League]], [[A-League]] and [[National Basketball League (Australasia)|NBL]].
For women, they are [[ANZ Netball Championships]], [[W-League (Australia)|W-League]] and [[WNBL]].

Famous Australian [[sports]] players include the [[cricket]]er Sir [[Donald Bradman]], the [[swimming|swimmer]] [[Ian Thorpe]] and the [[Sportsperson|athlete]] [[Cathy Freeman]].

=== Art festivals ===

Just 60 years ago, Australia had only one big Art festival. Now Australia has hundreds of smaller community-based festivals, and national and regional festivals that focus on specific art forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/arts_festivals.html | title=Art festivals | author=Australian government | accessdate=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wildlife ==
Australia is home to many animals that can be found nowhere else on Earth, which include: the [[koala]], the [[kangaroo]], the [[wombat]], the [[numbat]], the [[emu]], among many others...[[File:Numbat.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;|[[Numbat]]]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''American English''' or '''United States English''' is the [[dialect]] of [[English language]] spoken in the [[United States]]. It is different in some ways from other variations of English, such as [[British English]]. Historically, many types of American English can be found in old local dialects of England.

Many people today know about American English even if they live in a country where another form of English is spoken. This is partly because people hear and read American English via the [[mass media|media]], for example [[CNN]] television, and the [[Internet]], where the most common form of English is American English.

Because people all over the world use American English as well as other versions of English the English language can add new words. English has been changing for centuries, adding new words to its [[vocabulary]]. For example, the English language spoken in [[India]], which has more than one billion people, will add more American English words to go along with its British English base and many other words adopted into English usage in India from any of the 200+ Indian languages.

Sometimes people will learn American English as it is spoken in America. For example, in telephone call centers in India and other places, people often learn American English in order to sound more like their customers who call India from America. These people often continue to use American English in everyday life.

Many word definitions are different in American English. Most changes in a language start with small things. For instance [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[French language|French]] all came from [[Latin]].

==Spelling in American English==
There are many words that sound the same between American English and British English, but are spelled differently.  For example:

*Words originally from the French that end in &quot;-our&quot; in British English (behaviour, colour, honour, neighbour, etc.) end in &quot;-or&quot; in American English (behavior, color, honor, neighbor). 
&lt;br/&gt;Words of French origin that end in -re in British English (metre, centre) end in -er in American English. In these cases [[Canadian]] usage is to keep the British (and French) spelling.
*Verbs that end in -ise in British English (criticise, realise) end in -ize in American English (criticize, organize, realize). However, the -ize ending is optional in British English, and is shown as an alternative in British dictionaries.
*One of the changes introduced by Noah Webster is the change of the double &quot;l&quot; from words like &quot;travelled&quot; to &quot;traveled&quot;. 

Many of these differences can be traced to the works of Anglophobe [[Noah Webster]], who produced the American dictionary following the [[American War of Independence]].

Some more differences in American English:
* aluminium is spelled &quot;aluminum&quot;
* doughnut is spelled &quot;donut&quot;
* draught is spelled &quot;draft&quot;
* gaol (not common) is spelled &quot;jail&quot;
* plough is spelled &quot;plow&quot;

There are also some words in American English that are a bit different from British English, e.g.:
* aeroplane is called &quot;airplane&quot;
* ladybird is called &quot;ladybug&quot;
* lift is called &quot;elevator&quot;
* toilet is called &quot;bathroom&quot;, &quot;restroom&quot; or &quot;comfort station&quot;
* lorry is called &quot;truck&quot;
* nappies are called &quot;diapers&quot;
* petrol is called &quot;gas&quot; (or &quot;gasoline&quot;)
* the boot of a car is called a &quot;trunk&quot;
* a dummy is called a &quot;pacifier&quot;
* trousers are called &quot;pants&quot;
* underground is called &quot;subway&quot;
* football is called &quot;soccer&quot;
* braces are &quot;suspenders&quot; (&quot;suspenders&quot; in British-English refers to items of apparel worn around the lower leg by males to prevent socks/sox from sagging, and around the upper leg by women wearing stockings)

'''Aquaculture''' is the [[farming]] of [[fish]], [[shrimp]], and [[algae]]. Aquaculture supplies fish, such as [[catfish]], [[salmon]], and [[trout]]. Aquaculture was developed a long time ago in [[China]] and aquaculture supplies over 20% of all the seafood harvested. However aquaculture is quite a new activity in [[Canada]] as it only began in [[1879]]. It is- in simpler terms- the farming of seafood.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''abbreviation''' is a shorter way to write a word or phrase. People use abbreviations for words that they write a lot. The [[English language]] occasionally uses the [[apostrophe]] mark ' to show that a word is written in a shorter way, but some abbreviations do not use this mark. More often, they use [[Period (punctuation)|periods]], especially the ones that come from the [[Latin]] language. Common Latin abbreviations include '''i.e.''' [id est] ''that is'', '''e.g.''' [exempli gratia] ''for example'', and '''et al.''' [et alia] ''and others''.

Some new abbreviations have been created by [[scientist]]s, by workers in companies and governments, and by people using the [[Internet]]. 

People often think words are abbreviations when in fact they are [[acronym]]s.

Here are examples of common acronyms: The word &quot;[[radar]]&quot; is an [[acronym]] for &quot;Radio Detection and Ranging&quot;. The name of the large computer company [[IBM]] comes from the words &quot;International Business Machines&quot;. The name of the part of the [[United States]] government that sends [[rocket]]s into [[outer space]] is NASA, from the words &quot;National Aeronautics and Space Administration&quot;. When people using the Internet think that something is very funny, they sometimes write &quot;LOL&quot; to mean &quot;Laughing Out Loud&quot;. People sometimes write &quot;ASAP&quot; for &quot;As Soon As Possible&quot;.

In many mythologies and [[religion]]s, an '''angel''' is a good [[spirit]]. The word angel comes from the Greek word ''angelos'' which means &quot;messenger&quot;. Angels appear frequently in the [[Old Testament]], the [[New Testament]], [[Qur'an]] and [[Aqdas]]. 

==In the Bible==
Angels are powerful, smart spirits that obey God's commands and praise him with singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|26:53}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sometimes appear to [[human]]s in human form.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Hebrews|13:2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can deliver messages to people in person or in [[dream]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|1:20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angels that are named in the [[Bible]] are [[Michael]] (called a &quot;chief prince&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Daniel|10}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Gabriel]] (known for telling [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] that she would be the mother of [[Jesus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|1:26-38}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and Raphael (in the [[Apocrypha]]l [[Book of Tobit]]).&lt;ref name=ABF&gt;{{cite book|title=The Amazing Bible Factbook|year=2008|publisher=American Bible Society|location=New York|isbn=1603207783|pages=4-7, 179}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Ethiopia]]n [[Book of Enoch]] also lists four Archangels which watch over the four quadrants of heaven; Michael, Raphael, Gabriel and Uriel. Lucifer is also known as an angel in the Bible. 

===Types===
*'''Cherubim''' (plural of cherub) are described as &quot;winged creatures&quot; which have four wings&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezekiel|1:6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cherubim guard the [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] with a [[sword]] of fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|3:24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the author of Genesis was aware of different types of angels. Genesis 3:24 is found in the [[Book of Ezekiel]]. A Cherub is mentioned in Ezekiel 28:13-14, saying that the angel was in the Garden of God.&lt;ref&gt; The IVP New Bible Commentary pp734 states: ' the exact significance of the cherub is unclear'&lt;/ref&gt;

Ezekiel 28:13-14
13. Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepaired in thee in the day that thou wast created.
14. Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.

It describes the sound of their wings, &quot;like the roar of rushing waters.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezekiel|1:24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ezekiel 10:5-7 ; Ezekiel 10:8 reveals that they have hands like a man under their wings .

Ezekiel 1:7 KJV reveals that they look like man but are different because they have &quot;straight feet&quot; and four wings and four faces.

Ezekiel ch 1, and 10 describe the cherubim creatures ascending and descending from the earth with wheels. Ezekiel 1:14-20 ; Ezekiel 10:16

Ezekiel 10:9-13 describes what the wheels appeared to look like, and how they moved around, how they moved or flew through the sky quickly but turned not as they went; and how the inside workings of the wheels appeared to be &quot;a wheel in the midst of a wheel&quot; and that the color of the wheels was the color of &quot;Amber&quot; Stone. There are four separate wheels in both accounts, one for each single cherub which is there. 

*'''Seraphim''' (plural of seraph, which means &quot;burning&quot;)they also are depicted having wings, six of them. They are known for singing and praising God. They can shout so loud, they shake the [[temple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Isaiah|6:4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Archangels''' like Gabriel ([[Gospel of Luke]] 1:19) are the highest type of angel. They are considered [[saint]]s in the [[Catholic church]].&lt;ref name=ABF/&gt; However, in the King James Version of the Bible; they are another type of angel. In the [[Book of Revelation]] the Angel Michael casts the 'great dragon' [[Satan]] out of heaven and down to earth in a great battle between the good and bad angels, just before the Great Judgement of angels and man. (Revelation 12)

*The [[Leviathan]] in [[Book of Job]] 41:19-21 has flame that goes:  'out of his mouth' like a [[dragon]].  Isaiah 30:6 also talks of a 'fiery flying serpent'. Compare Revelation 20:2: , where an angel: 'laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the [[Devil]], and Satan, and bound him a thousand years'.

==In art==
They are often shown in art as having wings and a [[halo]]. The wings represent their speed, and the halo represents their holiness. 

The cherubim in art always appear as baby faced angels with very small non useful wings.

The cherubim statue or [[bronze]] casting of cherubim in the Temple of [[Solomon]] depicted them as two four winged creatures whose wings touched at the peak of the ark that they were making.

The same cherubim creatures were said to be cast in gold on top of the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. Casting metal is one of the oldest forms of artwork, and was attempted by [[Leonardo Da Vinci]].

==Angelology==
The study of Angels is called Angelology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theology.edu/theology/angel.htm Angelology]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ad hominem''' is a [[Latin language|Latin]] term. It is used in [[rhetoric]]. Rhetoric is the science of how to speak well, and how to convince other people of your [[idea]]s. 

Translated to English, ''ad hominem'' means ''against the person'' (Latin ''homo'', where ''hominem'' is a form is [[gender]]-neutral. In ancient [[Rome]] it referred to all free men, and by extension to all free human beings). 

The term is used to describe a rhetorical argument, that is directed towards the person who says something, not about the cause at hand. It is a way to use [[reputation]] and [[wikt:rumour|rumour]] and [[hearsay]] to change minds.

When a [[social network]] has already excluded or exiled one person, or applied a [[label]] to them, this works more often.

Because it works and is also [[unfair]] to everyone who would benefit from [[what]] they say, it is considered to be a weak or poor argument. [[Formal disapproval]] of those who use it is common in a [[court]] or in [[diplomacy]], where [[wikt:danger|danger]] is high.

== What an ad hominem argument looks like ==
In [[logic]], a [[wikt:proof|proof]] is something that starts with [[premise]]s, and goes through a few logical [[argument]]s, to reach a [[conclusion]].

=== Normal (valid) proof ===
# All [[human]]s are mortal
# [[Socrates]] is a man (he is human)
# Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

=== Ad hominem example ===
# Person A thinks [[abortion]] should be [[illegal]]
# Person A is uneducated and poor
# Therefore abortion should not be illegal.

In this example it can be seen that the (completely unrelated) fact that person A is uneducated and poor is used to prove that abortion should not be illegal.

'''Native Americans''' (also '''Aboriginal Americans''', '''American Indians''', '''Amerindians''', or '''Indigenous Peoples of America''') are the people who were in [[North America]], [[Central America]], [[South America]], and the [[Caribbean]] Islands when Europeans arrived. 
[[Christopher Columbus]] was travelling west, so he thought he was going to [[India]]. This is why he called the people &quot;Indians&quot;. There are more than three million Native Americans in Canada and the U.S. combined.

Sometimes these people are called &quot;Indians&quot;, but this is confusing, because it is the same word used for people from [[India]]. There are many different [[tribe]]s of Amerindian people, with many different languages. 

Many Amerindians died after the Europeans came to the Americas, from [[disease]]s that came with the Europeans that were new to the Amerindians, in [[war]]s with the Europeans, or because the Europeans made them work as [[slave]]s. Most of the Amerindians were hurt or killed by settlers who took their lands.

The ancestors of American Indians came to the Americas from [[Asia]]. Some of them may have come to America over 12,000 years ago when [[Alaska]] was connected to Asia by land.

Some Indian tribes and languages of North America are [[Cherokee]], [[Maya people|Maya]] or [[Yucatec]], [[Aztecs]], [[Navajo]], and [[Sioux]]. 

Some Indian tribes and languages of South America are [[Aymara people|Aymara]], [[Guaraní people|Guarani]], [[Quechua]], and [[Tupi]].

The '''apple''' is a [[Fleshy fruits#Pome|fleshy fruit]] from the apple [[tree]]. It is in the [[species]] ''Malus domestica'' in the [[rose]] family [[Rosaceae]]. The apple is one of the most [[tillage|grown]] tree fruits.

The apple tree came from [[Central Asia]]. Its wild ancestor is still there today. There are more than 7,500 kinds of different apple trees.&lt;ref name=England/&gt;

At least 55&amp;nbsp;million [[ton]]s of apples were grown around in the world in 2005. All together, they cost about $10&amp;nbsp;billion. [[People's Republic of China|China]] produced about 35% of the world's apples.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple&quot;/&gt; The [[United States]] produces more than 7.5% of the apples around the world. This makes it the second greatest producer. [[Iran]] is third, after which comes [[Turkey]], [[Russia]], [[Italy]] and [[India]].

== Botanical information ==

The apple has a small, leaf-shedding tree that grows up to 3 to 12&amp;nbsp;metres (9.8 to 39&amp;nbsp;ft) tall. The apple tree has a broad crown with thick [[twig]]s.
The [[leaf|leaves]] are [[Phyllotaxis|alternately arranged]] simple [[oval]]s. They are 5 to 12&amp;nbsp;[[centimeter|centimetres]] long and 3–6&amp;nbsp;centimetres (1.2–2.4&amp;nbsp;in) wide. It has a sharp top with a soft underside. [[Blossom]]s come out in [[spring]] at the same time that the leaves begin to bud. The [[flower]]s are white. They also have a slightly pink color. They are five [[petal]]ed, and 2.5 to 3.5&amp;nbsp;centimetres (0.98 to 1.4&amp;nbsp;in) in [[wikt:diameter|diameter]]. The fruit [[wikt:maturity|matures]] in [[autumn]]. It is usually 5 to 9&amp;nbsp;centimetres (2.0 to 3.5&amp;nbsp;in) in diameter. There are five [[carpel]]s arranged in a [[star]] in the middle of the fruit. Every carpel has one to three [[seed]]s.

=== Wild ancestors ===
The wild [[ancestor]]s of ''Malus domestica'' are ''Malus sieversii''. They grow wild in the [[mountain]]s of [[Central Asia]] in the south of [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Xinjiang]], [[People's Republic of China|China]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Architecture and size relations: an essay on the apple (Malus x domestica, Rosaceae) tree&quot;/&gt; and possibly also ''Malus sylvestris''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coart&quot;/&gt; Unlike [[wikt:domestication|domesticated]] apples, their leaves become red in autumn.&lt;ref&gt;Archetti M.

==History==

The apple tree was possibly the earliest tree to be cultivated.&lt;ref name=app6/&gt; Its fruits have become better over thousands of years. It is said that [[Alexander the Great]] discovered [[wikt:small|dwarfed]] apples in [[Asia Minor]] in 300 [[BCE]]. [[Asia]] and [[Europe]] have used winter apples as an important food for thousands of years. From when [[Europe]]ans arrived, [[Argentina]] and the [[United States]] have used apples as food as well.&lt;ref name=app6&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.vegparadise.com/highestperch39.html
|title= An apple a day keeps the doctor away
|accessdate= 27 January 2008
|publisher=vegparadise.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apples were brought to [[North America]] in the 1600s. The first apple [[orchard]] on the North American continent was said to be near [[Boston]] in 1625. In the 1900s, costly fruit [[industry|industries]], where the apple was a very important species, began developing.&lt;ref name=app3/&gt;

== In culture ==
=== Germanic paganism ===
[[Image:Carl Larsson Brita as Iduna.jpg|thumb|&quot;Brita as [[Iðunn|Iduna]]&quot; (1901) by Carl Larsson]]

In [[Norse mythology]], the goddess [[Iðunn]] gives apples to the gods in ''Prose Edda'' (written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]) that makes them young forever. English [[wikt:scholar|scholar]] H. R. Ellis Davidson suggests that apples were related to [[religion|religious]] practices in [[Germanic paganism]]. It was from there, she claims, that [[Norse paganism]] developed. She points out that buckets of apples were discovered in the place of burial for the Oseberg [[ship]] in [[Norway]]. She also remarks that fruit and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]] (Iðunn having been described as changing into a nut in ''Skáldskaparmál'') have been discovered in the early [[grave]]s of the [[Germanic peoples]] in [[England]]. They have also been discovered somewhere else on the continent of Europe. She suggests that this may have had a [[symbol]]ic meaning. Nuts are still a symbol of [[fertility]] in Southwest England.

Sometimes apples are eaten after they are [[cooked]]. Often apples are eaten uncooked. Apples can also be made into [[drink]]s. [[Apple juice]] and apple [[cider]] are apple drinks. 

The flesh of the fruit is firm with a taste anywhere from sour to sweet. Apples used for cooking are sour, and need to be cooked with sugar, while other apples are sweet, and do not need cooking. There are some seeds at the core, that can be removed with a [[tool]] that removes the core, or by carefully using a [[knife]].

The [[scientific name]] of the apple tree genus in the [[Latin]] language is ''Malus''. Most apples that people grow are of the ''Malus domestica'' species.

Most apples are good to eat [[raw]] (not cooked), and are also used in many kinds of [[bake]]d foods, such as [[apple pie]]. Apples are cooked until they are [[wikt:soft|soft]] to make [[apple sauce]].

Apples are also made into the [[drink]]s [[apple juice]] and [[cider]]. Usually, cider contains a little [[alcohol]], about as much as [[beer]]. The regions of [[Brittany]] in [[France]] and [[Cornwall]] in [[England]] are known for their apple ciders.

If one wants to grow a certain type of apple it is not possible to do this by planting a seed from the wanted type. The seed will have [[DNA]] from the apple that the seeds came from, but it will also  have DNA from the apple flower that [[pollinate]]d the seeds, which may well be a different type. This means that the tree which would grow from planting would be a mixture of two. In order to grow a certain type of apple, a small twig, or 'scion', is cut from the tree that grows the type of apple desired, and then added on to a specially grown [[stump]] called a rootstock. The tree that grows will only create apples of the type needed.

== Apple cultivars ==

There are more than 7,500 known [[cultivar]]s of apples.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elzebroek&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Elzebroek|first=A.T.G.|coauthors=Wind, K.|title=Guide to Cultivated Plants|publisher=CAB International|location=Wallingford|date=2008|page=27|isbn=1845933567|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YvU1XnUVxFQC&amp;lpg=PT39&amp;dq=apple%20cultivars%207%2C500&amp;pg=PT39#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different cultivars are available for [[temperate]] and [[subtropical]] climates.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; apple cultivars is at the National Fruit Collection in [[England]]. Most of these cultivars are grown for eating fresh (dessert apples). However, some are grown simply for cooking or making [[cider]]. Cider apples are usually too [[wikt:tart|tart]] to eat immediately. However, they give cider a rich flavor that dessert apples cannot.&lt;ref name=&quot;apples1&quot;&gt;{{cite web

== In the United Kingdom ==
In the [[United Kingdom]] there are about 3000 different types of apples. The most common apple type grown in England is the 'Bramley seedling', which is a popular cooking apple.

Apple orchards are not as common as they were in the early 1900s, when apples were rarely brought in from other countries. Organizations such as [http://www.commonground.org.uk/ Common Ground] teach people about the importance of rare and local varieties of fruit. '[[Apple Day]]' is celebrated each [[October 21]] in many countries.

== In North America ==
Many apples are grown in [[temperate]] parts of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. In many areas where apple growing is important, people have huge celebrations:

* [[Annapolis Valley Apple Blossom Festival]] - held five days every spring (May-June) in [[Nova Scotia]]
* [[Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival]] - held six days every spring in [[Winchester, Virginia]].
* [[Washington State Apple Blossom Festival]] - held two weeks every spring (April-May) in [[Wenatchee, Washington]]

== Varieties of apples ==
[[File:Golden delicious apple.jpg|right|thumb|A Golden Delicious apple.]]
There are lots of different varieties of apples, including:

* [[Fuji (apple)]]
* [[Gala]]
* [[Golden Delicious]] (some times called a Green Delicious Apple)
* [[Granny Smith]]
* [[Jonagold]]
* [[McIntosh]]
* [[Pink Lady]]
* [[Red Delicious]]
* [[Winesap]]

== Family ==
Apples are in the group [[Maloideae]]. It is a subfamily of the family ''[[Rosaceae]]''. They are in the same subfamily as [[pear]]s. Its family is the family of rose like plants, and roses are in the family.

People use the term '''Abrahamic religion''' for a number of [[religion]]s that recognise [[Abraham]] as an important person. The best known and probably most popular Abrahamic religions are [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and the [[Bahá'í Faith]].

Even though these religions are different from each other in many ways, they also agree in many other very important ways on the basic general nature of the one [[God]] whom they worship.

The word &quot;Abrahamic&quot; refers to the ancient [[prophet]] [[Abraham]], who is respected in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

Another thing Abrahamic religions have in common is that they are &quot;[[monotheism|Monotheistic]]&quot; (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words for &quot;one&quot; and &quot;God&quot;), meaning belief in just one God.

They also all believe that people should [[pray]] to this God often.

      <comment>/* Associative property of multiplication */ Division is *not* associative</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Algebra''' is a part of [[mathematics]] (often called ''math'' in the [[United States]] and '''maths''' in the [[United Kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Math or Maths|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Mathematics.html|publisher=Wolfram.com|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ). It uses [[variable]]s to represent a value that is not yet known.  When an equals sign (=) is used, this is called an [[equation]].  A very simple equation using a variable is: &lt;tt&gt;2 + 3 = x&lt;/tt&gt;   In this example, &lt;tt&gt;x = 5&lt;/tt&gt;, or it could also be said, &quot;x is five&quot;.  This is called ''solving for x''.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Algebra Introduction|url=http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/introduction.html|publisher=Math Is Fun|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides equations, there are [[inequality|inequalities]] (''less than'' and ''greater than''). A special type of equation is called the function.  This is often used in making [[graph]]s.

Algebra can be used to solve real problems because the rules of algebra work in real life and numbers can be used to represent the values of real things.  [[Physics]], [[engineering]] and [[computer programming]] are areas that use algebra all the time.  It is also useful to know in [[surveying]], [[construction]] and [[business]], especially [[accounting]].

People who do algebra need to know the rules of [[number]]s and mathematic [[operation (mathematics)|operations]] used on numbers, starting with [[addition|adding]], [[subtraction|subtracting]], [[multiplication|multiplying]], and [[division (mathematics)|dividing]].  More advanced operations involve [[exponent]]s, starting with [[square (algebra)|squares]] and [[square root]]s. Many of these rules can also be used on the variables, and this is where it starts to get interesting.

Algebra was first used to solve [[algebraic equation|equations]] and inequalities. Two examples are [[linear equation]]s (the equation of a line, &lt;tt&gt;y=mx+b&lt;/tt&gt;) and [[quadratic equation]]s, which has variables that are squared (power of two, a number that is multiplied by itself, for example: &lt;tt&gt;2*2, 3*3, x*x&lt;/tt&gt;).  How to [[factorization|factor]] [[polynomial]]s is needed for quadratic equations.

== History ==
Early forms of algebra were developed by the [[Babylonian]]s and the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. However the word &quot;algebra&quot; is a [[Latin language|Latin]] form of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''Al-Jabr'' (&quot;casting&quot;) and comes from a mathematics book ''Al-Maqala fi Hisab-al Jabr wa-al-Muqabilah'', (&quot;Essay on the Computation of Casting and Equation&quot;) written in the [[9th century]] by a famous [[Iran|Persian]] mathematician, [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]], who was a [[Islam|Muslim]] born in [[Khwarizm]] in [[Uzbekistan]]. He flourished under Al-Ma'moun in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]] through 813-833 AD, and died around 840 AD. The book was brought into [[Europe]] and [[translation|translated]] into Latin in the [[12th century]]. The book was then given the name 'Algebra'. (The ending of the mathematician's name, al-Khwarizmi, was changed into a word easier to say in Latin, and became the English word ''[[algorithm]]''.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Algebra|url=http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~sxw8045/history.htm|publisher=UCS Louisiana|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Examples==

Here is a simple example of an algebra problem:

:Sue has 12 jellybeans, Ann has 24 jellybeans. They decide to share so that they have the same number of jellybeans. 

These are the steps you can use to solve the problem:

# To have the same number of jellybeans, Ann has to give some to Sue.  Let ''x'' represent the number of jellybeans Ann gives to Sue. 
# Sue's jellybeans, plus ''x'', must be the same as Ann's jellybeans minus ''x''.  This is written as: &lt;tt&gt;12 + x = 24 - x&lt;/tt&gt; 
# Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation. This gives: &lt;tt&gt;x = 12 - x&lt;/tt&gt;.  (What happens on one side of the equals sign must happen on the other side too, for the equation to still be true. So in this case when 12 was subtracted from both sides, there was a middle step of &lt;tt&gt;12 + x - 12 = 24 - x - 12&lt;/tt&gt;.  After a person is comfortable with this, the middle step is not written down.)
# Add ''x'' to both sides of the equation. This gives: &lt;tt&gt;2x = 12&lt;/tt&gt;
# Divide both sides of the equation by 2. This gives &lt;tt&gt;x = 6&lt;/tt&gt;. The answer is six.  If Ann gives Sue 6 jellybeans, they will have the same number of jellybeans.
# To check this, put 6 back into the original equation wherever ''x'' was: &lt;tt&gt;12 + 6 = 24 - 6&lt;/tt&gt;
# This gives &lt;tt&gt;18=18&lt;/tt&gt;, which is true.  They both now have 18 jellybeans.

With practice, algebra can be used when faced with a problem that is too hard to solve any other way. Problems such as building a freeway, designing a cell phone, or finding the cure for a disease all require algebra.

== Writing algebra ==
As in most parts of mathematics, adding ''z'' to ''y'' (or ''y'' plus ''z'') is written as &lt;tt&gt;y + z&lt;/tt&gt;.
Subtracting ''z'' from ''y'' (or ''y'' minus ''z'') is written as &lt;tt&gt;y − z&lt;/tt&gt;.
Dividing ''y'' by ''z'' (or ''y'' over ''z'': &lt;math&gt;y \over z&lt;/math&gt;) is written as &lt;tt&gt;y ÷ z&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;y/z&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;y/z&lt;/tt&gt; is more commonly used.

In algebra, multiplying ''y'' by ''z'' (or ''y'' times ''z'') can be written in 4 ways: &lt;tt&gt;y × z&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;y * z&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;y·z&lt;/tt&gt;, or just &lt;tt&gt;yz&lt;/tt&gt;. The multiplication symbol &quot;×&quot; is usually not used, because it looks too much like the letter x, which is often used as a variable.  Also, when multiplying a larger expression, parentheses can be used: &lt;tt&gt;y (z+1)&lt;/tt&gt;.

When we multiply a number and a letter in algebra, we write the number in front of the letter: &lt;tt&gt;5 × y = 5y&lt;/tt&gt;. When the number is 1, then the 1 is not written because 1 times any number is that number (1 × ''y'' = ''y'') and so it is not needed.

== Functions and Graphs ==
[[File:Linear equation for y=3x+1.png|thumb|Linear equation for y=3x+1]]
An important part of algebra is the study of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], since functions often appear in equations that we are trying to solve. A function is like a box you can put a number or numbers into and get a certain number out. When using functions, [[graph]]s can be powerful tools in helping us to study the solutions to equations. 

A graph is a picture that shows all the values of the variables that make the equation or inequality true. Usually this is easy to make when there are only one or two variables. The graph is often a line, and if the line does not bend or go straight up-and-down it can be described by the basic formula &lt;tt&gt;y = mx + b&lt;/tt&gt;. The variable ''b'' is the [[y-intercept]] of the graph (where the line crosses the vertical axis) and ''m'' is the [[slope]] or steepness of the line. This formula applies to the [[Cartesian coordinate system|coordinates]] of a graph, where each point on the line is written &lt;tt&gt;(x, y)&lt;/tt&gt;.  

In some math problems like the equation for a line, there can be more than one variable (''x'' and ''y'' in this case).  To find points on the line, one variable is changed. The variable that is changed is called the &quot;independent&quot; variable.  Then the math is done to make a number. The number that is made is called the &quot;dependent&quot; variable. Most of the time the independent variable is written as ''x'' and the dependent variable is written as ''y'', for example, in &lt;tt&gt;y = 3x + 1&lt;/tt&gt;.  This is often put on a graph, using an ''x'' axis (going left and right) and a ''y'' axis (going up and down).  It can also be written in function form: &lt;tt&gt;f(x) = 3x + 1&lt;/tt&gt;.  So in this example, we could put in 5 for ''x'' and get &lt;tt&gt;y = 16&lt;/tt&gt;.  Put in 2 for ''x'' would get &lt;tt&gt;y=7&lt;/tt&gt;.  And 0 for ''x'' would get &lt;tt&gt;y=1&lt;/tt&gt;.  So there would be a line going thru the points (5,16), (2,7), and (0,1) as seen in the graph to the right.

If x has a power of 1, it is a straight line.  If it is squared or some other power, it will be curved.  If it uses an inequality (''&lt;'' or ''&gt;''), then usually part of the graph is shaded, either above or below the line.

== Rules of algebra ==
In algebra, there are a few rules that can be used for further understanding of equations. These are called the rules of algebra. While these rules may seem senseless or obvious, it is wise to understand that these properties do not hold throughout all branches of mathematics. Therefore, it will be useful to know how these axiomatic rules are declared, before taking them for granted. Before going on to the rules, reflect on two definitions that will be given.
# Opposite - the opposite of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;-a&lt;/math&gt;.
# Reciprocal - the reciprocal of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{a}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Rules ===

==== Commutative property of addition ====
'Commutative' is another word for reciprocal. In other words, the order of the terms in an equation do not matter. When the operator of two terms is an addition, the 'commutative property of addition' is applicable. In algebraic terms, this gives &lt;math&gt;a + b = b + a&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that this does not apply for subtraction! (i.e. &lt;math&gt;a - b \ne b - a&lt;/math&gt;)

==== Commutative property of multiplication ====
When the operator of two terms is an multiplication, the 'commutative property of multiplication' is applicable. In algebraic terms, this gives &lt;math&gt;a \cdot b = b \cdot a&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that this does not apply for division! (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} \ne \frac{b}{a}&lt;/math&gt;)

==== Associative property of addition ====
'Associative' refers to the grouping of numbers. The associative property of addition implies that, when adding three or more terms, it doesn't matter how these terms are grouped. Algebraically, this gives &lt;math&gt;a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c&lt;/math&gt;. Note that this does not hold for subtraction, e.g. &lt;math&gt;1 = 0 - (0 - 1) \neq (0 - 0) - 1 = -1&lt;/math&gt; (see the distributive property).

==== Associative property of multiplication ====
The associative property of multiplication implies that, when multiplying three or more terms, it doesn't matter how these terms are grouped. Algebraically, this gives &lt;math&gt;a \cdot (b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c&lt;/math&gt;. Note that this does not hold for division, e.g. &lt;math&gt;2 = 1/(1/2) \neq (1/1)/2 = 1/2&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Distributive property ====
The distributive property states that the multiplication of a number by another term can be distributed. For instance: &lt;math&gt;a \cdot (b + c) = ab + ac&lt;/math&gt;. (Do ''not ''confuse this with the associative properties! For instance, &lt;math&gt;a \cdot (b + c) \ne (a \cdot b) + c&lt;/math&gt;.)

==== Additive identity property ====
'Identity' refers to the property of a number that it is equal to itself. In other words, there exists an operation of two numbers so that it equals the variable of the sum. The additive identity property states that the sum of any number and 0 is that number: &lt;math&gt;a + 0 = a&lt;/math&gt;. This also holds for subtraction: &lt;math&gt;a - 0 = a&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Multiplicative identity property ====
The multiplicative identity property states that the product of any number and 1 is that number: &lt;math&gt;a \cdot 1 = a&lt;/math&gt;. This also holds for division: &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{1} = a&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Additive inverse property ====
The additive inverse property is somewhat like the opposite of the additive identity property. When an operation is the sum of a number and its opposite, and it equals 0, that operation is a valid algebraic operation. Algebraically, it states the following: &lt;math&gt;a - a = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Multiplicative inverse property ====
The multiplicative inverse property entails that when an operation is the product of a number and its reciprocal, and it equals 1, that operation is a valid algebraic operation. Algebraically, it states the following: &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{a} = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Advanced Algebra==
In addition to &quot;[[elementary algebra]]&quot;, or basic algebra, there are advanced forms of algebra, taught in colleges and universities, such as [[abstract algebra]], [[linear algebra]], and [[universal algebra]]. 
This includes how to use a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] to solve many linear equations at once. ''[[Abstract algebra]]'' is the study of things that are found in equations. For example, polynomials and matrices. These things are known as algebraic structures. Understanding the properties of more complex [[algebraic structure]]s can help us solve more complex equations.

Many math problems are about physics and engineering. In many of these physics problems time is a variable. Time uses the letter ''t''. Using the basic ideas in algebra can help reduce a math problem to its simplest form making it easier to solve difficult problems. Energy is ''e'', force is ''f'', mass is ''m'', acceleration is ''a'' and speed of light is sometimes ''c''.  This is used in some famous equations, like &lt;tt&gt;f = ma&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;e=mc^2&lt;/tt&gt; (although more complex math beyond algebra was needed to come up with that last equation).

An '''atom''' is the basic unit that makes up all [[matter]]. There are many different types of atoms, each with its own name, [[mass]] and size. These different types of atoms are called [[chemical element]]s. The chemical elements are organized on the periodic table. Examples of elements are [[hydrogen]] and [[gold]]. Atoms are very small, but the exact size changes depending on the element. Atoms range from 0.1 to 0.5 [[nanometer]]s in width.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/MichaelPhillip.shtml|title=Size of an Atom}}&lt;/ref&gt; One nanometer is around 100,000 times smaller than the width of a human [[hair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/1999/BrianLey.shtml|title=Diameter of a Human Hair}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes atoms impossible to see without special tools. [[Equation]]s must be used to see the way they work and how they interact with other atoms. 

Atoms come together to make [[molecule]]s or particles: for example, two hydrogen atoms and one [[oxygen]] atom combine to make a [[water]] molecule, a form of a [[chemical]] reaction. 

Atoms themselves are made up of three kinds of smaller particles, called [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s and [[electron]]s. The protons and neutrons are in the middle of the atom. They are called the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. The nucleus is surrounded by a cloud of electrons with a negative [[Electric charge|charge]] which are bound to the nucleus by an [[electromagnetic]] force. 

Protons and neutrons are made up of even smaller particles called [[quark]]s. Electrons are [[elementary particle|elementary or fundamental particles]]; they cannot be split into smaller parts. 

The number of protons, neutrons and electrons an atom has determines what element it is. Hydrogen, for example, has one proton, no neutrons and one electron;  the element [[sulfur]] has 16 protons, 16 neutrons and 16 electrons.

Atoms move faster when in gas form (as they are free to move) than liquid and solid matter. In solid [[wikt:material|materials]] the atoms are tightly next to each other so they {{broken wikt link|vibrate|vibrate}}, but are not able to move (there is no room) as atoms in liquids do.

== History ==
The word &quot;atom&quot; comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀτόμος, ''{{broken wikt link|indivisible|indivisible}}'', from ἀ-, ''not,'' and τόμος, ''a cut.'' The first historical mention of the word atom came from works by the Greek [[philosophy|philosopher]] Democritus, around 400 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.winneconne.k12.wi.us/ms_teachers/LENZ/history_of_atomic_theory.htm|title=History of Atomic Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atomic theory stayed as a mostly [[philosophy|philosophical]] subject, with not much actual scientific investigation or study, until the development of [[chemistry]] in the 1600s. 

In 1777 [[France|French]] chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier]] defined the term ''element'' for the first time. He said that an [[chemical element|element]] was any basic substance that could not be broken down into other substances by the methods of chemistry. Any substance that could be broken down was a ''[[Chemical compound|compound]]''.&lt;ref name=Brief&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.cerritos.edu/ladkins/a106/a%20brief%20history%20of%20the%20atom.htm|title=A Brief History of the Atom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1803, [[England|English]] philosopher [[John Dalton]] suggested that elements were tiny, solid spheres made of atoms. Dalton believed that all atoms of the same element have the same mass. He said that compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine. According to Dalton, in a compound, atoms of different elements always combine the same way.

In 1827, British scientist Robert Brown looked at [[pollen]] grains in water and used Dalton's atomic theory to describe patterns in the way they moved.  This was called ''Brownian Motion''. In 1905 [[Albert Einstein]] used mathematics to prove that the seemingly random movements were down to the reactions of atoms, and by doing so he conclusively proved the existence of the atom.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~nd/surprise_95/journal/vol4/ykl/report.html|title=Brownian motion - a history}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1869 scientist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] published the first version of the [[periodic table]]. The periodic table groups atoms by their [[atomic number]] (how many [[proton]]s they have. This is usually the same as the number of [[electron]]s). 
Elements in the same column, or period, usually have similar properties. For example [[helium]], [[neon]], [[argon]], [[krypton]] and [[xenon]] are all in the same column and have very similar properties. All these elements are [[gas]]es that have no colour and no smell. Together they are known as the [[noble gas]]es.&lt;ref name=Brief /&gt;

The physicist [[J.J. Thomson]] was the first man to discover electrons. This happened while he was working with [[cathode ray]]s in 1897. He realized they had a negative [[electric charge|charge]], unlike protons (positive) and neutrons (no charge). Thomson created the [[plum pudding model]], which stated that an atom was like plum pudding: the dried fruit (electrons) were stuck in a mass of pudding (protons). In 1909, a scientist named [[Ernest Rutherford]] used the [[Geiger–Marsden experiment]] to prove that most of an atom is in a very small space called the [[atomic nucleus]]. Rutherford took a photo plate and surrounded it with gold foil, and then shot alpha particles at it. Many of the particles went through the gold foil, which proved that atoms are mostly empty space. Electrons are so small they make up only 1% of an atom's [[mass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://ion.elte.hu/~akos/orak/atfsz/atom/rutherford_atom11.pdf|title=Ernest Rutherford on Nuclear spin and Alpha Particle interaction.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Ernest Rutherford.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Ernest Rutherford in  1910, shortly before he won the [[Nobel Prize]] for [[physics]].]]

In 1913, [[Niels Bohr]] introduced the [[Bohr model]]. This model showed that electrons orbit the nucleus in fixed circular orbits. This was more accurate than the Rutherford model. However, it was still not completely right. Improvements to the Bohr model have been made since it was first introduced.

In 1925, chemist [[Frederick Soddy]] found that some elements in the periodic table had more than one kind of atom.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1921/soddy-bio.html|title=Frederick Soddy, the Nobel Prize in chemistry: 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
For example any atom with 2 protons should be a [[helium]] atom. Usually, a helium [[Nucleus (physics)|nucleus]] also contains two neutrons. However, some helium atoms have only one neutron. This means they are still helium, as the element is defined by the number of protons, but they are not normal helium either. Soddy called an atom like this, with a different number of neutrons, an ''[[isotope]]''. To get the name of the isotope we look at how many protons and neutrons it has in its [[Nucleus (physics)|nucleus]] and add this to the name of the element. So a helium atom with two protons and one neutron is called helium-3, and a carbon atom with six protons and six neutrons is called carbon-12. However, when he developed his theory Soddy could not be certain neutrons actually existed. To prove they were real, physicist James Chadwick and a team of others created the [[mass spectrometer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1935/chadwick-lecture.html|title=James Chadwick: The Nobel Prize in Physics 1935, a lecture on the Neutron and its properties}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mass spectrometer actually measures the mass and weight of individual atoms. By doing this Chadwick proved that to account for all the weight of the atom, neutrons must exist. 

In 1937, [[Germany|German]] chemist [[Otto Hahn]] became the first person to create [[nuclear fission]] in a laboratory. He discovered this by chance when he was shooting neutrons at a [[uranium]] atom, hoping to create a new isotope.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.chemheritage.org/classroom/chemach/atomic/hahn-meitner.html|title=Otto Hahn, Liese Meitner and Fritz Strassman}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he noticed that instead of a new isotope the uranium simply changed into a [[barium]] atom. This was the world's first recorded nuclear fission reaction. This discovery eventually led to the creation of the [[atomic bomb]]. 

Further into the 20th century physicists went deeper into the mysteries of the atom. Using [[particle accelerator]]s they discovered that protons and neutrons were actually made of other particles, called [[quarks]].

The most accurate model so far comes from the [[Schrödinger equation]]. Schrödinger realized that the electrons exist in a cloud around the nucleus, called the [[electron cloud]]. In the electron cloud, it is impossible to know exactly where electrons are. The Schrödinger equation is used to find out where an electron is likely to be. This area is called the electron's [[atomic orbital|orbital]].

== Structure and parts ==
=== Parts ===

The complex atom is made up of three main particles; the [[proton]], the [[neutron]] and the [[electron]]. The [[isotope]] of [[Hydrogen]] Hydrogen-1 has no neutrons, and a positive hydrogen [[ion]] has no electrons. These are the only known exceptions, all other atoms have at least one proton, neutron and electron each. 

Electrons are by far the smallest of the three, their mass and size is too small to be measured using current technology.&lt;ref name=park&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://sciencepark.etacude.com/particle/structure.php|title=Particle Physics - Structure of a Matter}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have a negative [[Electric charge|charge]]. Protons and neutrons are of similar size to each other&lt;ref name=park /&gt; Protons are positively charged and neutrons have no charge. 
Most atoms have a neutral charge; because the number of protons (positive) and electrons (negative) are the same, the charges balance out to zero. However in [[ion]]s (different number of electrons) this is not always the case and they can have a positive or a negative charge. Protons and Neutrons are made out of [[quark]]s, of two types; up quarks and down quarks. A proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark and a neutron is made of two down quarks and one up quark.

=== Nucleus ===
The nucleus is in the middle of an atom. It is made up of protons and neutrons. Usually in nature, two things with the same charge repel or shoot away from each other. So for a long time it was a mystery to scientists how the positively charged protons in the nucleus stayed together. They solved this by finding a particle called a [[Gluon]]. Its name comes from the word ''[[glue]]'' as Gluons act like atomic glue, sticking the protons together using the ''strong nuclear force''.  It is this force which also holds the quarks together that make up the protons and neutrons.

[[File:Nuclear fusion forces diagram.svg|thumb|left|250px|A diagram showing the main difficulty in [[nuclear fusion]], the fact that protons, which have positive charges, repel each other when forced together.]]

The number of neutrons in relation to protons defines whether the nucleus is stable or goes through [[radioactive decay]]. When there are too many neutrons or protons, the atom tries to make the numbers the same by getting rid of the extra particles. It does this by emitting radiation in the form of [[alpha particle|alpha]], [[beta particle|beta]] or [[gamma ray|gamma]] decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/quantskills/methods/quantlit/RadDecay.html|title=How does radioactive decay work?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclei can change through other means too. [[Nuclear fission]] is when the Nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei, releasing a lot of stored [[energy]]. This release energy is what makes nuclear fission useful for making [[bomb]]s and [[electricity]], in the form of [[nuclear power]]. 
The other way nuclei can change is through [[nuclear fusion]], when two nuclei join together, or fuse, to make a heavier nucleus. This process requires extreme amounts of energy in order to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the protons, as they have the same charge. Such high energies are most common in [[star]]s like our [[Sun]], which fuses hydrogen for fuel.

=== Electrons ===
{{main|Electron}}

Electrons  orbit or go around the nucleus. They are called the atom's ''electron cloud''. They are attracted towards the nucleus because of the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic force]]. Electrons have a negative charge and the nucleus always has a positive charge, so they attract each other. 
Around the nucleus some electrons are further out than others. These are called ''electron shells''. In most atoms the first shell has two electrons, and all after that have eight. Exceptions are rare, but they do happen and are difficult to predict.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.chemtutor.com/struct.htm#str|title=Chemtutor on atomic structure}}&lt;/ref&gt; The further away the electron is from the nucleus, the weaker the pull of the nucleus on it. This is why bigger atoms, with more electrons, react more easily with other atoms.
The electromagnetism of the nucleus is not enough to hold onto their electrons and they lose them to the strong attraction of smaller atoms. &lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.sciencebyjones.com/chemical_reactivity.htm|title=Chemical reactivity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radioactive decay ==
{{main|Radioactive decay}}

Some elements, and many isotopes, have what is called an ''unstable nucleus''. This means the nucleus is either too big to hold itself together&lt;ref name=Splung&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.splung.com/content/sid/5/page/radioactivity|title=Radioactivity}}&lt;/ref&gt; or has too many protons, electrons or neutrons. When this happens the nucleus has to get rid of the excess mass or particles. It does this through [[radiation]]. An atom that does this can be called ''radioactive''. Unstable atoms continue to be radioactive until they lose enough mass/particles that they become stable. All atoms above atomic number 82 (82 protons) are radioactive.&lt;ref name=Splung /&gt;

There are three main types of radioactive decay; [[alpha decay|alpha]], [[beta decay|beta]] and [[gamma ray|gamma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.s-cool.co.uk/gcse/physics/radioactivity/types-of-radiation.html|title=S-Cool: Types of radiation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Alpha decay]] is when the atom shoots out a particle having two protons and two neutrons. This is essentially a [[helium]] nucleus. The result is an element with atomic number two less than before. So for example if a [[beryllium]] atom (atomic number 4) went through alpha decay it would become helium (atomic number 2). Alpha decay happens when an atom is too big and needs to get rid of some mass.

* [[Beta decay]] is when a neutron turns into a proton or a proton turns into a neutron. In the first case the atom shoots out an electron, in the second case it is a [[positron]] (like an electron but with a positive charge). The end result is an element with one higher or one lower atomic number than before. Beta decay happens when an atom has either too many protons, or too many neutrons.

* [[Gamma ray|Gamma decay]] is when an atom shoots out a [[gamma ray]], or wave.  It happens when there is a change in the [[energy]] of the nucleus. This is usually after a nucleus has already gone through alpha or beta decay. There is no change in the mass, or atomic number or the atom, only in the stored energy inside the nucleus.

Every radioactive element or isotope has something called a ''half life''. This is how long it takes half of any sample of atoms of that type to decay until they become a different stable isotope or element.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/isotopes/radioactive_decay3.html|title=What is half-life?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large atoms, or isotopes with a big difference between the number of protons and neutrons will therefore have a long half life.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Astronomy''' is the study of the [[universe]] and everything in it. This includes [[star]]s, [[planet]]s and [[galaxies]] as well as other things. The word astronomy comes from the Greek words ''astron'' which means [[star]] and ''nomos'' which means [[law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=astronomy|title=Astronomy - and etymology|accessdate=2008-11-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person who studies astronomy is called an '''astronomer'''.

Astronomy is one of the oldest [[science]]s. Ancient people used the positions of the stars to navigate, and to find when was the best time to plant [[crops]]. Astronomy is very similar to [[astrophysics]]. Since the 20th century there have been two main types of astronomy, ''Observational'' and ''Theoretical'' astronomy. Observational astronomy uses [[telescope]]s and [[camera]]s to ''[[wikt:observe|observe]]'' or look at stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects. Theoretical astronomy uses [[maths]] and [[computer model]]s to predict what should happen. The two often work together, the theoretical predicts what should happen and the observational shows whether the prediction works. 

Astronomy is not the same as ''[[astrology]]'', the belief that the patterns the stars and the planets may affect [[human]] lives. 

== History of Astronomy ==
{{main|History of astronomy}}
=== Ancient ===
Early astronomers used only their eyes to look at the stars. They used [[map]]s of the [[constellation]]s and stars for religious reasons and also to work out the time of year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=17322&amp;pageno=5|title=An online book - Gutenberg history of Astronomy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early civilisations such as the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] people and the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians built simple [[observatory|observatories]] and drew maps of the stars positions. They also began to think about the place of [[Earth]] in the [[universe]]. For a long time people thought [[Earth]] was the center of the universe, and that the planets, the stars and the sun went around it. This is known as the ''geocentric'' model of [[the Universe]]. 

Arabic astronomers made many advancements during the [[Middle Ages]] including improved star maps and ways to estimate the size of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/1612/medieval.html|title=A brief history of Astronomy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renaissance to Modern Era ===

[[File:Galileo moon phases.jpg|thumb|portrait|upright|Drawings of [[the Moon]] by Galileo. His drawings were more detailed than anyone before him because he used a telescope to look at the Moon.]]
During the [[renaissance]] a priest named [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] thought, from looking at the way the planets moved, that the Earth was not the center of everything. He said the Earth was a [[planet]] and all the planets moved around the sun. This is known as a ''Heliocentric'' model. A physicist called [[Galileo Galilei]] built his own [[telescope]], and used it to look more closely at the stars and planets for the first time. He agreed with Copernicus.  Their ideas were also improved by [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton]] who came up with the [[wikt:theory|theory]] of [[gravity]]. At this time the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[church]] decided that Galileo was wrong. [[The Pope]] gave the order to lock Galileo up in his house and they did not let him write any more [[book]]s until he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/bio/narrative_7.html|title=Galileo Project - Galileo and the inquisition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Galileo, people made better telescopes and used them to see farther objects such as the planets [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]. They also saw how stars were similar to our Sun, but in a range of colours and sizes. They also saw thousands of other faraway objects such as [[Galaxy|galaxies]] and [[nebula]]e.

=== Modern Era ===  

The 20th century saw important changes in astronomy.

In 1931, Karl Jansky discovered radio emission from outside the Earth when trying to isolate a source of noise in radio communications, marking the birth of radio astronomy and the first attempts at using another part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] to observe the sky. Those parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that the atmosphere did not block were now opened up to astronomy, allowing more discoveries to be made.

The opening of this new window on the [[Universe]] saw the discovery of entirely new things, for example [[pulsar]]s, which sent regular pulses of radio waves out into space. The waves were first thought to be alien in origin because the pulses were so regular that it implied an artificial source.

The period after [[World War 2]] saw more [[observatory|observatories]] where large and accurate telescopes are built and operated at good observing sites, normally by governments.  For example, [[Bernard Lovell]] began radio astronomy at Jodrell Bank using leftover military [[radar]] equipment.  By 1957, the site had the largest steerable radio telescope in the world.&lt;!--can not use Wikipedia as reference &lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovell_Telescope|title=Wikipedia entry on the Lovell Telescope}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;  Similarly, the end of the 1960s saw the start of the building of dedicated observatories at [[Mauna Kea]] in [[Hawaii]], a good site for visible and infra-red telescopes thanks to its high altitude and clear skies.  Mauna Kea would eventually come to host very large and very accurate telescopes like the Keck Observatory with its 10-meter mirror.  

The next great revolution in astronomy was thanks to the birth of rocketry.  This allowed telescopes to be placed in space on [[satellite (artificial)|satellites]].

Satellite-based telescopes opened up the Universe to human eyes. Turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere blurs images taken by ground-based telescopes, an effect known as seeing.  It is this effect that makes stars &quot;twinkle&quot; in the sky.  As a result, the pictures taken by satellite telescopes in visible light (for example, by the Hubble Space Telescope) are much clearer than Earth-based telescopes, even though Earth-based telescopes are very large.

[[Space observatory|Space telescopes]] gave access, for the first time in history, to the entire [[electromagnetic spectrum]] including rays that had been blocked by the atmosphere.  The [[X-ray]]s, [[gamma ray]]s, [[ultraviolet]] light and parts of the [[infra-red]] spectrum were all opened to astronomy as observing telescopes were launched.  As with other parts of the spectrum, new discoveries were made.

The period from 1970s onwards can be generalised that satellites were launched to be replaced with more accurate and better satellites, causing the sky to be mapped in nearly all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.

=== Future Plans ===

Making new progress in astronomy is becoming more limited by the observatories and facilities being used at this time.  To make up for these limitations, astronomers have proposed larger and more ambitious projects.  These proposals, some of which are being examined already by governments to see if they will be funded, allow us to glimpse into what the astronomers are planning for the future of astronomy.

== Discoveries ==

This section summarises all the discoveries that Astronomy has made.

Discoveries broadly come in two types:  bodies and phenomena.  Bodies are things in the Universe, whether it is a planet like our Earth or a galaxy like our Milky Way.  Phenomena are events and happenings in the Universe.  

=== Bodies ===

For convenience, this section has been divided by where these astronomical bodies may be found: those found around stars are solar bodies, those inside galaxies are galactic bodies and everything else larger are cosmic bodies.

==== Solar ====

* [[Planet]]s
* [[Asteroid]]s
* [[Comet]]s

==== Galactic ====

[[Star]]s

Diffuse Objects:
* [[Nebula]]s
* Clusters

Compact Stars:
* [[White dwarf|White dwarves]]
* [[Neutron star]]s
* [[Black hole]]s

==== Cosmic ====

* [[Galaxy|Galaxies]]
* Clusters
* Superclusters.

=== Phenomena ===

Phenomena are events and happenings in the Universe.  Broadly, they can be divided into three types: burst, periodic and noise.  

Burst events are those where there is a sudden change in the heavens that disappears quickly.  These are called bursts because they are normally associated with large explosions producing a &quot;burst&quot; of energy.  They include: 
* [[Supernova]]s
* [[Nova]]s

Periodic events are those that happen regularly in a repetitive way.  The name periodic comes from period, which is the length of time required for a [[Wave (physics)|wave]] to complete one cycle.  Periodic phenomena include: 
* [[Pulsar]]s
* [[Variable star]]s

Noise phenomena tend to relate to things that happened a long time ago.  The signal from these events bounce around the Universe until it seems to come from everywhere and varies little in intensity.  In this way, it resembles &quot;noise&quot;, the background signal that pervades every instrument used for astronomy.  The most common example of noise is static seen on analogue televisions.  The principal astronomical example is: 
* [[Cosmic background radiation]].

== Methods ==
=== Instruments ===
Much of astronomy is done through observation of the heavens using instruments.  

* [[Telescopes]] are the main tool of observing. They take all the light in a big area and put in into a small area. This is like making your eyes very big and powerful. Astronomers use telescopes to look at things that are far away and dim. Telescopes make objects look bigger, closer, brighter. 
* [[Spectrometer]]s study the different [[wavelength]]s of light. This shows what something is made of. 
* Many telescopes are in satellites. They are [[space observatory|space observatories]]. 

=== Techniques ===
There are way  astronomers can get better pictures of the heavens.  Light from a distant source reaches a [[sensor]] and gets measured, normally by a human eye or a camera.  For very dim sources, there may not be enough light particles coming from the source for it to be seen.  One technique that astronomers have for making it visible is using ''integration'', (which is like longer exposures in [[photography]]).

==== Integration ====
Astronomical sources do not move much: only the rotation and movement of the Earth causes them to move across the heavens. As light particles reach the camera over time, they hit the same place making it brighter and more visible then the background, until it can be seen.  

Telescopes at most observatories (and satellite instruments) can normally track a source as it moves across the heavens, making the star appear still to the telescope and allowing longer exposures.  Also, images can be taken on different nights so exposures span hours, days or even months.

In the digital era, digitised pictures of the sky can be added together by [[computer]], which overlays the images after correcting for movement.

==== Aperture Synthesis ====
With [[radio telescope]]s smaller telescopes can be combined together to create a big one, which works like one as big as the distance between the two smaller telescopes.

==== Adaptive Optics ====
[[Adaptive optics]] means changing the shape of the mirror or lens while looking at something, to see it better.

=== Data Analysis ===
Data analysis is the process of getting more information out of an astronomical observation than by simply looking at it.  

The observation is first stored as data.  This data will then have various techniques applied to it (to ''analyse'' it), out of which we may get an answer.

==== Fourier Analysis ====
[[Fourier analysis]] in mathematics can show if an observation (over a length of time) is changing periodically (changes like a wave).  If so, it can extract the frequencies and the type of wave pattern, and find many things including new planets.

== Fields ==

Astronomy is a very large subject with many different things to study. Many astronomers specialise in particular areas of astronomy, called fields.  Fields are often themselves further sub-divided into sub-fields and so on.

Astronomers assign fields based on what they perceive to be the largest differences between different bodies and phenomena.  However, as astronomers learn more about the Universe, they often notice that things which they thought were different at first turn out to be similar and things which were similar turn out to be different.  As a result, fields in astronomy are constantly changing.

A good example of changing fields comes from pulsars which pulse regularly in radio waves.  These turned out to be similar to some (but not all) of a type of bright source in X-rays called a Low Mass X-ray Binary.  It turned out that all pulsars and some LMXBs are neutron stars and that the differences were due to the environment in which the neutron star was found.  Those LMXBs that were not neutron stars turned out to be black holes.

Because of its changing nature, the organisation of astronomy can be confusing, even to astronomers. There are also many terms which have both modern and older meanings.  

This section attempts to provide an overview of the important fields of astronomy, their period of importance and the terms used to describe them. It should be noted that astronomy in the Modern Era has been divided mainly by electromagnetic spectrum, although there is some evidence this is changing.

For convenience, the fields are grouped by the major difference that inspired them.

=== Fields by Body ===
==== Solar Astronomy ====
{{main|Sun}}

Solar Astronomy is the study of the [[Sun]]. The Sun is the closest star to Earth at around 92 million (92,000,000) miles away.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF1/142.html|title=Sun/Earth distance, article #144|accessdate=2009-3-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the easiest to observe in detail. Observing the Sun can help us understand how other stars work and are formed. Changes in the Sun can affect the weather and climate on Earth. A stream of charged [[particle]]s called the [[Solar wind]] is constantly sent off from the Sun. The Solar Wind hitting the Earth's [[magnetic field]] causes the [[Aurora|northern lights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/Isun.html|title=The Solar Wind and the Van Allen radiation belts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studying the Sun helped people understand how [[nuclear fusion]] works.

==== Planetary Astronomy ====

Planetary Astronomy is the study of [[planet]]s, [[Satellite (natural)|moons]], [[dwarf planet]]s, [[comet]]s and [[asteroid]]s as well as other small objects that orbit stars. The planets of our own [[Solar System]] have been studied in depth by many visiting [[spacecraft]] such as [[Cassini-Huygens]] ([[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]]) and the [[Voyager 1]] and [[Voyager 2|2]].

==== Galactic Astronomy ====

Galactic Astronomy is the study of distant [[galaxy|galaxies]].  Studying distant galaxies is the best way of learning about our own galaxy, as the gases and stars in our own galaxy make it difficult to observe.  Galactic Astronomers attempt to understand the structure of galaxies and how they are formed through the use of different types of telescopes and computer simulations.

=== Fields by Electromagnetic Spectrum ===
==== Radio Astronomy ====
''See [[Radio telescope]]''

==== MagnetoHydroDynamics ====
MagnetoHydroDynamics, called MHD for short, is Hydrodynamics done in the presence of [[magnetic field]]s, where  Hydrodynamics is the [[mathematical model]]ling of fluid flows.  Hydrodynamics is already useful in astronomy for mathematically modelling how gases behave (as gases behave like fluids).  Strong magnetic fields found around many bodies can drastically change how these gases behave, affecting things from star formation to the flows of gases around compact stars, making MHD a very important and useful tool in astronomy.

=== Other Fields ===
==== Gravitational Wave Astronomy ====
Gravitational Wave Astronomy is the study of the [[Universe]] in the gravitational wave spectrum.  So far, all astronomy that has been done has used the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].  Gravitational Waves are ripples in [[spacetime]] emitted by very dense objects changing shape, which include [[White dwarf|white dwarves]], [[neutron star]]s and [[black hole]]s.  Because no one has been able to detect gravitational waves directly, the impact of Gravitational Wave Astronomy has been very limited.

'''Architecture''' is the [[science]] of the [[design]] of [[structure]]s or [[building]]s such as houses, places of worship, office buildings.  Architecture is also the [[profession]] of an [[architect]]. A person must [[wikt:study|study]] at an [[institution]] of [[higher education]] to become an [[architect]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Architecture can be about small designs such as a [[garage]] or large designs such as a whole [[city]]. Architecture often overlaps with [[civil engineering]], and architects and civil engineers often work together.

__TOC__

== History ==
[[File:Saint Leonardo vault.PNG|thumb|left|Romanesque groin vault]]
In the past people built [[wikt:hut|hut]]s and wood [[house]]s to protect themselves from the weather. For safety, they were often close together. Great [[civilization]]s like the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians built large [[temples]] and structures, like the [[Great Pyramids of Giza]]. The [[Ancient Greek]]s and [[ Ancient Rome|Roman]]s made what we now call [[Classical Architecture]]. The Romans, working over 2000 years ago, copied the [[arch]] from the [[Etruscans]], who copied it from the [[Mesopotamia]]ns. The [[stone]] [[column]]s, which still hold up so many important buildings, like the [[Parthenon]] in [[Athens]], were simply copied from the first wooden posts.

[[File:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|right|Pyramids in [[Giza]]]]
'''Classical Architecture''' was very formal; it always obeyed [[laws]]. It used [[symmetry]], which really means [[wikt:simple:balance|balance]], and it used [[proportion]] which means keeping shapes in certain ways. The [[Golden Ratio|Golden Mean]] was a rule (or law) which said, (to put it very simply) if you are making a room, or any other thing, it will work best if you always make the long side 1.6 times longer than the short side. There are many laws in Classical Architecture, like how high the middle of an arched [[bridge]] needs to be (which depends on how wide the bridge needs to be). These laws were learned from thousands of [[year]]s of experience and they are as true today as they were 2000 years ago.

In some parts of the world, like [[India]], the architecture is famous for [[carving]] the stone on temples and palaces. Different architectural styles were made in [[China]], [[Japan]], Southeast Asia, [[Africa]], [[Mexico]], and Central and [[South America]].

Later, people in [[Western Europe]] in the [[Middle Ages]] made [[Romanesque architecture]], then [[Gothic architecture]].  Gothic buildings have tall, pointed [[window]]s and arches.  Many [[church]]es have Gothic architecture. [[Castle]]s were also built at this time. In [[Eastern Europe]], churches usually had [[dome]]s. People added their own ideas and [[decoration]] to the Classical Architecture of the past.  The [[Renaissance]] brought a return to classical ideas. 
[[File:NYC - Guggenheim Museum.jpg|thumb|left|There can be many different kinds of styles to architecture, such as the curved dome on the [[Guggenheim Museum]] in [[New York City]]]]
In the late 18th century with the [[Industrial Revolution]], people began to [[invent]] machines to make things quickly and cheaply. Many [[factory|factories]] and [[Mill (factory)|mills]] were built during, or after this revolution. Decades later, in the [[Victorian era]], architects like [[George Fowler Jones]] and [[Decimus Burton]] still followed the Gothic style to build new churches. Up to this point, buildings were limited in size and style by the strength of the wood and [[masonry]] used to construct them. Gothic cathedrals were among the largest buildings because the gothic arch when combined with buttresses allowed stone buildings to be built taller. For example, the cathedral in [[Ulm]], Germany is over 500 feet tall. However, building with stone has its limits, and building too tall could result in collapse, an example of which is the [[Beauvais Cathedral]], which was never completed. 
[[File:Sears Tower ss.jpg|thumb|New technology allows new kinds of buildings such as for the [[Willis Tower]] in [[Chicago]]]]

Towards the end of the 19th Century with a second Industrial Revolution, [[steel]] became much cheaper. Architects began to use inventions like metal [[girder]]s and [[reinforced concrete]] to build. An example is the [[Eiffel Tower]] in [[Paris]]. Buildings can now be built taller than ever before. We call them [[skyscrapers]]. This new [[technology]] has made us free from traditional limitations, and because of the new possibilities presented by these materials, many traditional methods of construction and ideas about style were reevaluated, replaced, or abandoned. Cheap, strong glass soon brought transparent exterior walls, especially for office buildings. 

[[Modernism]] is the name for the architectural style which developed because of these new building technologies, and its beginnings can been seen as early as [[1890]]. Modernism can also refer to a specific group of architects and buildings from the early to late 20th century, and so may not be the proper term to use for many building built since then, which are sometimes called &quot;post-modern&quot;.

Many of the world's greatest structures were build by modern day architects such as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[I. M. Pei]], [[Adrian Smith (architect)|Adrian Smith]], [[Edward Durell Stone]], [[Fazlur Khan]], and [[Bruce Graham]].

'''Anatomy''' is the [[research|study]] of the [[body|bodies]] of living beings.  This can be [[human|people]], [[animal]]s, or [[plant]]s. It is like taking the body apart, and looking at its parts ([[organ (anatomy)|organs]], [[muscle]]s and [[bone]]s). People who study ''anatomy'' then look where a certain organ (or bone, or muscle) should be, or where it normally is.

The history of anatomy dates back to 1600 BCE when [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] began studying human anatomy. They discovered the functions of many organs like the liver, spleen, kidneys, heart etc. and were the first to discover the structure and functions of the lymphatic system.

[[Academic]] human anatomists are usually employed by universities, medical schools or teaching hospitals. They are often involved in teaching anatomy, and research into certain systems, organs, tissues or cells.

==Body Systems==

There are different systems, such as the cardiovascular system, also known as the [[circulatory system]] (the system that gets [[blood]] around the body), the muscular system (the system that contains [[muscle]]s), the [[nervous system]] (the system that controls the [[nerve]]s,and the brain) and the [[skeleton]] (the bones). 

Human anatomy, [[physiology]] and [[biochemistry]] are similar basic medical sciences.

An '''asteroid''' is a small object in the [[Solar System]] that travels around the [[Sun]]. It is like a [[planet]], but smaller. The name &quot;asteroid&quot; means &quot;like a star&quot; in the ancient [[Greek language]]. Asteroids may look like small stars in the sky, but they really do move around the [[Sun]], while stars only seem to move because the [[Earth]] spins. Like planets, asteroids do not make their own [[light]]. Because of this, some people think &quot;asteroids&quot; is not a good name, and think that the name &quot;planetoid&quot; (&quot;like a planet&quot;) would be a better name.

Giuseppe Piazzi found the first asteroid, in 1801. It was named [[Ceres]], and is the biggest object in the [[asteroid belt]]. Other asteroids in the asteroid belt, like [[3 Juno|Juno]], [[Pallas]], and [[Vesta]] were found later. Today, astronomers using computerized [[telescope]]s find thousands of asteroids every month, which range from 1 km (less than a mile) to 600 miles (1000 km) across. 

Asteroids are the leftover rock and other material from the formation of the [[Solar System]]. These rocks were too small to make a planet, and could not collide to form one. Most asteroids are made of [[mineral|rock]], but some are made of [[carbon]] or [[metal]]. Depending on what's on the surface, they are classified into various kinds in including Type M (metal), Type S (stone), and Type C (carbon).

Most asteroids in our [[Solar System]] are in the [[asteroid belt]] between [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] and [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]. Many are not in the main asteroid belt. The ones that come close to Earth are called Near Earth Objects (NEO). Many scientists think asteroids striking the Earth killed off [[K/T extinction event|all the dinosaurs]] and caused some of the other [[extinction event]]s.

In early times people passed through it with animals and other goods as it connected China and India with Central Asia and the Middle East. More recently, Afghanistan has been damaged by many years of war and no jobs.

The country is around 251,826 square [[miles]] (652,230 square kilometers) in size or area. There are 30 million people in Afghanistan. There are about 3 million Afghan [[refugees]] who are in Pakistan and Iran for some time. [[Kabul]], the big city, had about 3,691,400 people living in it in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;cso.gov.af&quot;&gt;http://cso.gov.af/Content/files/2-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Land and climate ==
[[File:Black Hawk flying over a valley in Bamyan.jpg|left|thumb|Snow-capped Koh-i-Baba mountains in [[Bamyan Province]] of Afghanistan.]]
Afghanistan has many [[mountains]]. The mountains are called [[Hindu Kush Range]] and [[Himalayas]]. The big mountain in Afghanistan is [[Noshaq|Mount Nowshak]]. There are [[plains]] (which have soil that is good for growing plants) and [[foothills]]. Part is also dry and called the [[Registan Desert]].

Afghanistan has snow and [[glaciers]] in the mountains. [[Amu Darya]] is the big water stream, or river.

Afghanistan is dry and cold in winter and hot in summer. No water sometimes causes problems for [[farmers]]. [[Sandstorms]] happen a lot in the [[desert]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Afghanistan.&quot; Britannica Student Library. Encyclopaedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The country has a lot of a [[valuable]] [[stone]] called [[lapis lazuli]], which was used to decorate the [[tomb]] of the [[Egypt]]ian king [[Tutankhamun]].&lt;ref name=ngk&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/kids/places/find/afghanistan/ |title=Afghanistan Facts and Pictures |work=National Geographic Kids |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plants and Animals ==
[[File:Uncia uncia 2.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Endangered [[snow leopard]]s live in the cold [[Hindu Kush]], but they have thick [[fur]] to stay warm. Hunters sell the soft leopard skins in the markets in the capital [[Kabul]].]]
[[South]]ern Afghanistan has not many plants because it is dry. There are more plants where there is more water. Mountains have [[forests]] of [[pine]] and [[fir]]. [[cedar]], [[oak]], [[walnut]], [[alder]], and [[ash tree]]s.

Afghanistan's animals are in the mountains. There are [[wolves]], [[foxes]], [[jackals]], [[bears]], and wild [[goat]]s, [[gazelle]]s, wild dogs, [[camel]]s, and [[wild cat]]s such as the [[snow leopard]] in the country. The birds are [[falcon]]s, [[eagles]] and [[vulture]]s. The [[Rhesus Macaque]] and the red flying [[squirrel]] are also in Afghanistan.

Many years of [[war]], [[hunting]], and years of no water have killed animals in Afghanistan. [[Tigers]] used to be in Afghanistan, but they are [[extinct]], which means that there are no more tigers there. Bears and wolves are almost gone.&lt;ref name=ngk/&gt;

== People and culture ==
[[File:2011 Afghan Youth Voices Festival.jpg|thumb|left|The 2011 Afghan Youth Voices Festival at the Gardens of Babur in [[Kabul]].]]
Many different cultures have moved through or invaded the land of Afghanistan. Today the people of Afghanistan, known as ''Afghans'', have many traits passed down from these groups. The largest ethnic group is the [[Pashtuns]] (or ethnic Afghans), who make up about half the Afghan people.&lt;ref&gt;See:

The country's other ethnic groups include the [[Hazara]], [[Uzbek]], [[Aimak]], [[Turkmen]], [[Nuristani people|Nuristani]], [[Baloch people|Baloch]], Pashai and a few others.

Most people who live in cities can speak more than one language. Dari is the native or mother language of the Tajik, Hazara, and some other groups. Both Pashto and Dari belong to the [[Indo-European languages]], but they are usually written with the [[Arabic alphabet]]. [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] and [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] are widely spoken in the north and [[Nuristani language|Nuristani]] and [[Pashai language|Pashai]] are spoken in the east.&lt;ref name=AO/&gt; Almost all Afghans follow the religion of [[Islam]].

Afghanistan is a largely [[rural]] country, which means that there are only few major cities and much spaced-apart land. Only about one fifth of the population lives in cities. [[Kabul]], the capital, is the largest city. It is along the [[Kabul River]] south of the [[Hindu Kush]] range. Other cities in Afghanistan include [[Kandahar]], [[Herat]], [[Mazar-e Sharif]], and [[Jalalabad]]. The rural population is made up of farmers and nomads (people who move or travel from place to place). The farmers live mainly in small villages along the rivers. The nomads live in tents while moving from place to place with their animals and belongings. Some Afghan people live in the high central mountains or the deserts in the south and southwest. Millions of people escaped from Afghanistan in order to not get involved in the wars that happened in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Most of them lived in neighboring Pakistan and Iran.

== History ==
Afghanistan is in the [[Trail|path]] of important trade routes that connect southern and eastern [[Asia]] to [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]]. Because of this, many empire builders have decided to rule over the area. Signs that these emperors were near Afghanistan still exist in many parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[Encyclopedia Britannica, Afghanistan History. Retrieved on 26 January 2009 http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/7798/Afghanistan/129450/History#ref=ref261360]&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan is near what used to be the [[Silk Road]], so it has many cultures. From up to 8,000 years ago, the peoples of Afghanistan helped develop (create) major world religions, traded and exchanged much merchandise, and sometimes controlled politics and culture in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Hiebert, F., Cambon, P., 2008, AFGHANISTAN Hidden Treasures from the National Museum, Kabul, page 56, Washington, National Geographic, ISBN 978-1-4262-0295-7&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prehistory ===
[[File:Raffael 071.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Zoroaster]], the founder of [[Zoroastrianism]], lived in [[Bactria]], an ancient land in the north of today's Afghanistan.]]
[[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] digging a cave in what is now northeastern Afghanistan (in [[Badakhshan Province|Badakhshan]]), discovered that people lived in the country as early as 100,000 years ago. They found the skull of a [[Neanderthal]], or early human, as well as tools from about 30,000 years ago. In other parts of Afghanistan, archaeologists uncovered [[pottery]] and tools that are 4,000 to 11,000 years old—evidence that Afghans were among the first people in the world to grow crops and raise animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;&quot;Afghanistan.&quot; Britannica Elementary Library. Encyclopaedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Kaunakes Bactria Louvre AO31917.jpg|left|thumb|150px|A Stone Female Figurine, known as '''Bactrian Princess''', from [[Bactria]], north of Afghanistan, about 4,000 years ago]]

Farmers and herders settled in the plains surrounding the [[Hindu Kush]] as early as 7000 B.C. These people may have grown rich off the [[lapis lazuli]] they found along riverbeds, which they traded to early city sites to the west, across the [[Iranian plateau]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. As farms and villages grew and thrived in Afghanistan, these ancient people eventually invented [[irrigation]] (digging ditches for water so it flows to crops) that allowed them to grow crops on the northern Afghanistan desert plains. This [[civilization]] is today called BMAC ([[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex]]), or the &quot;Oxus civilization&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hiebert, F., Cambon, P., 2008, AFGHANISTAN Hidden Treasures from the National Museum, Kabul, page 58, Washington, National Geographic, ISBN 978-1-4262-0295-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oxus civilization expanded as far east as western edge of the [[Indus Valley]] during the period between 2200 and 1800 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Hiebert, F., Cambon, P., 2008, AFGHANISTAN Hidden Treasures from the National Museum, Kabul, page 73, Washington, National Geographic, ISBN 978-1-4262-0295-7&lt;/ref&gt; These people, who were the ancestors of the Indo-Aryans, used the term &quot;[[Aryan]]&quot; to identify their ethnicity, culture, and religion. Scholars know this when they read the ancient texts of these people; the [[Avesta (religious scripture)|Avesta]] of Iranian people and the [[Vedas]] of Indo-Aryans.&lt;ref&gt;[R.

According to the Avesta, Aryans settled in sixteen districts in the area, beginning with ''Airiana vaejo'' (land of Aryans), and following with Bāxδī = Bactria or [[Balkh]]; Nisāya = a district between Margiana and Bactria; Harōiva = Areia or [[Herat|Herāt]]; Vaēkərəta = Gandhāra; Urvā = [[Ghazni Province|Ghazni]] region; Haraxᵛaitī = Arachosia or [[Kandahar]]; Haētumant = [[Helmand Province|Helmand]] region; Raγa = a district north of Haraxᵛaitī and Haētumant; Čaxra = Čarx between Ghazni and Kabul, in the valley of Logar.&lt;ref&gt;[Encyclopedia Iranica, AVESTAN GEOGRAPHY.

[[Zoroaster]], the founder of the [[Zoroastrian]] religion, the world's earliest [[monotheistic]] religion, lived in the area (somewhere north of today's Afghanistan), around 1000 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranica.com/articles/zoroaster-ii-general-survey Encyclopaedia Iranica: ZOROASTER ii. GENERAL SURVEY. By W. W. Malandra] In the Avesta, the geography of the Vendīdād and of the Yashts make it clear that these texts locate themselves in eastern [ancient] Iran [today's Afghanistan]. Even though there are later traditions which place him in Azerbaijan and Media, it is more reasonable to locate Zoroaster somewhere in today's Afghanistan along with the rest of the Avesta. Further, the two Avestan dialects belong linguistically to eastern [ancient] Iran [today's Afghanistan]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient history ===
[[File:Ancient Khorasan highlighted.jpg|thumb|Names of territories during the [[Caliphate]] in 750 CE. [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] was part of Persia (in [[yellow]]ish).]]
By the middle of the sixth century BC, the [[Achaemenids]] took over control of the land, which was previously held by the [[Medes]], and made it part of the [[Persian empire]]. [[Alexander the great]] defeated and conquered the Persian Empire in 330 BC. He founded some cities in the area and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] culture and language continued to influence the people for a long period, right up to the [[Islamic conquest]] in the 7th century A.D. After Alexander, [[Greco-Bactrians]], [[Scythians]], [[Kushans]], [[Parthians]] and [[Sassanians]] ruled the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/851961/ancient-Iran |title=ancient Iran |work=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kushans spread [[Buddhism]] from [[India]] in the 1st century B.C., and Buddhism remained an important religion in the area until the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;[Encyclopedia Iranica, BUDDHISM i. In Pre-Islamic Times. Retrieved on 12 September 2010 http://iranica.com/articles/buddhism-i]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]] were the remainder of Buddhism in Afghanistan. Those giant statues were destroyed by the very religious [[Taliban]] in 2001, despite international protests in defence of the priceless art. The Taliban believed that those ancient statues were [[Islam|un-Islamic]] and a curse on Afghanistan.

=== Medieval history ===

[[Arabs]] introduced [[Islam]] in the 7th century and slowly began spreading the new religion. In the 9th and 10th centuries, many local Islamic dynasties rose to power inside Afghanistan. One of the earliest was the [[Tahirids]], whose kingdom included [[Balkh]] and [[Herat]]; they established independence from the [[Abbasids]] in 820. The Ṭahirids were succeeded in about 867 by the [[Saffarids]] of [[Zaranj]] in western Afghanistan. Local princes in the north soon became [[wikt:feudatory|feudatories]] of the powerful [[Samanids]], who ruled from [[Bukhara]]. From 872 to 999, north of the Hindu Kush in Afghanistan enjoyed a golden age under Samanid rule.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Afghanistan.&quot; Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopaedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 10th century, the local [[Ghaznavid Empire|Ghaznavids]] turned [[Ghazni]] into their capital and firmly established Islam throughout all areas of Afghanistan, except the Kafiristan region in the northeast. [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], a great Ghaznavid [[sultan]], conquered the [[Multan]] and [[Punjab region]], and carried raids into the heart of [[India]]. Mohammed bin Abdul Jabbar Utbi (Al-Utbi), a historian from the 10th century, wrote that thousands of &quot;Afghans&quot; were in the Ghaznavid army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Houtsma&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=E.J.

Arab geographers even spoke of its extending to the boundaries of [[Hindustan|India]].''|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |date=|accessdate=2010-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

All the major cities of modern Afghanistan were centers of science and culture in the past. The New Persian [[literature]] arose and flourished in the area. The early Persian poets such as [[Rudaki]] were from what is now Afghanistan. Moreover, [[Ferdowsi]], the author of [[Shahnameh]], the national [[Epic poetry|epic]] of Iran, and [[Rumi]], the famous [[Sufi]] poet, were also from modern-day Afghanistan. It has produced scientists such as [[Avicenna]], [[Al-Farabi]], [[Al-Biruni]], [[Omar Khayyám]], [[Al-Khwarizmi]], and many others who are widely known for their important contributions in different domains such as [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[medicine]], [[physics]], [[geography]], and [[geology]]. It remained the cultural capital of Persia until the devastating [[Mongol]] invasion in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lorentz, J. Historical Dictionary of Iran. 1995 ISBN 0-8108-2994-0 AFGHANISTAN&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Timur]], the Turkic conqueror, took over in the end of the 14th century and began to rebuild cities in this region. Timur's successors, the [[Timurids]] (1405–1507), were great patrons of learning and the arts who enriched their capital city of Herat with fine buildings. Under their rule Afghanistan enjoyed peace and prosperity.

Between south of the Hindu Kush and the Indus River (today's Pakistan) was the native land of the Afghan tribes. They called this land &quot;Afghanistan&quot; (meaning &quot;land of the Afghans&quot;). The Afghans ruled the rich northern Indian subcontinent with their capital at [[Delhi]]. From the 16th to the early 18th century, Afghanistan was disputed between the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]] of [[Isfahan]] and the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] of [[Agra]] who had replaced the [[Lodi dynasty|Lodi]] and [[Sur Empire|Suri]] Afghan rulers in India. The Safavids and Mughals occasionally oppressed the native Afghans but at the same time the Afghans used each empire to punish the other. In 1709, the [[Hotaki dynasty|Hotaki]] Afghans rose to power and completely defeated the Persian Empire. Then they marched towards the Mughals of India and nominally defeated them with the help of the Afsharid forces under Nader Shah Afshar. 

In 1747, after Nader Shah of Persia was killed, a great leader named [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] united all the different Muslim tribes and established the Afghan Empire ([[Durrani Empire]]). He is considered the founding father of the modern state of Afghanistan&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; while [[Mirwais Hotak]] is the grandfather of the nation.

=== Recent history ===

During the 1800s, Afghanistan became a buffer zone between two powerful empires, [[British India]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. As British India advanced into Afghanistan, Russia felt threatened and expanded southward across Central Asia. To stop the Russian advance, British tried to make Afghanistan part of its empire but the Afghans fought wars with British-led Indians from 1839 to 1842 and from 1878 to 1880. After the third war in 1919, Afghanistan under [[Amanullah Khan|King Amanullah]] gained respect and recognition as a completely independent state.

From 1933 to the 1970s, the country remained stable but the creation of Pakistan in 1947 as its eastern neighbor created problems. In 1973, political crises led to the overthrow of the king. The country's new leader ended the monarchy and made Afghanistan a [[republic]]. In 1978, a [[Communist]] political party supported by the [[Soviet Union]] seized control of Afghanistan's government. This move sparked rebellions throughout the country. The government asked the Soviet Union for military assistance. The Soviets took advantage of the situation and [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|invaded Afghanistan in December 1979]].

Most people in Afghanistan opposed the sudden Soviet presence in their country. For nearly a decade, anti-Communist Islamic forces known as ''Mujahideen'' were trained inside neighboring Pakistan to fight the Soviets and the Afghan government. The [[United States]] and other anti-Soviet countries supported the Mujahideen. In the long war, over one million Afghan civilians were killed. The Soviet Army also lost more than 15,000 soldiers in that war. Millions of Afghans left their country to stay safe in neighboring Pakistan and Iran. In 1989 the Soviet Army withdrew the last of its troops.
[[File:2011 Afghan Independence Day-2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[President of Afghanistan|Afghan President]] [[Hamid Karzai]] at the 2011 Afghan Independence Day in [[Kabul]].]]
After the Soviets left, different Afghan warlords began fighting for control of the country. The warlords received support from other countries, including neighboring Pakistan and Iran. A very conservative [[Islamic]] group known as the [[Taliban]] emerged in an attempt to end the civil war. By the late 1990s the Taliban had gained control over 95% of Afghanistan. A group known as the Northern Alliance, based in northern Afghanistan near the border with Tajikistan, continued to fight against the Taliban.
[[File:Afghan soldiers.jpg|left|thumb|[[NATO]]-trained [[Afghan National Army]] (ANA).]]
[[File:Military terminal at Kabul International Airport.jpg|thumb|upright|NATO's military terminal at [[Kabul International Airport]]]]
The Taliban ruled Afghanistan according to their strict version of Islamic law. People whom the Taliban believed violated these laws were given cruel punishments. In addition, the Taliban completely restricted the rights of women. Because of such policies, most countries refused to recognize the Taliban government. Only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirate (UAE) accepted them as the official government.

The Taliban also angered other countries by allowing suspected terrorists to live freely in Afghanistan. Among them were [[Osama bin Laden]] and members of [[al-Qaeda]] terrorist network. In September 2001, the United States blamed bin Laden for the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon outside Washington, D.C.]] The Taliban refused to hand him over to the United States. In response, the United States and its allies launched a bombing campaign against al-Qaeda in October 2001. Within months the Taliban abandoned Kabul and a new government led by [[Hamid Karzai]] came to power, but fighting between the Taliban and US-led armies continued. The Taliban are coming into Afghanistan from neighboring Pakistan, Afghans accuse Pakistan's military for being behind the Taliban militants but Pakistan has been rejecting this and stating that a stable Afghanistan is in Pakistan's own interest.

In December 2004, Hamid Karzai became the first [[democracy|democratically]] elected president of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; [[NATO]] began rebuilding Afghanistan, including its military and government institutions. Many schools and colleges were built in the last ten years. Freedom for women improved, they can study, work, drive and run for offices. Many Afghan women work as politicians, some are ministers while at least one is a mayor. Others have opened businesses, or joined the military or police. Afghanistan's over-all economy has also improved dramatically and NATO states had agreed in 2012 to help the country for at least another 10 years after 2014. In the meantime, Afghanistan improved diplomatic ties with many countries in the world and continues to establish new ties with other states.

'''Argentina''' (officially called '''Argentine Republic''')  is a country in [[South America]]. Argentina is the second-largest [[country]] in [[South America]] and the eighth-largest country in the world. 

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the language most people speak and the official language, but many other languages are spoken. Some of these are [[German language|German]], [[Guaraní language|Guarani]], [[Mapudungun]] and [[Quechua]] and even [[Welsh language|Welsh]] in [[Patagonia]].

The [[capital (city)|capital city]] of the Argentina is [[Buenos Aires]], one of the largest cities in the world, in eastern Argentina. In order by number of people, the largest [[city|cities]] in Argentina are [[Buenos Aires]], [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[Rosario]], [[Mendoza]], [[La Plata]], [[Tucumán]], [[Mar del Plata]], [[Salta]], [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], and [[Bahía Blanca]]. 

Argentina is between the [[Andes]] [[mountain range]] in the west and the southern [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the east and south. It is bordered by [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]] in the north, [[Brazil]] and [[Uruguay]] in the northeast, and [[Chile]] in the west and south. It also claims the [[Falkland Islands]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Islas Malvinas'') and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]].

== History ==
The name '''Argentina''' comes from the [[Latin]] ''argentum'' ([[silver]]) as the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s believed the area had [[silver]]. In the Americas, Canada, US, Brazil and Argentina are the largest countries (in that order).

The oldest signs of people in Argentina are in the [[Patagonia]] (Piedra Museo, Santa Cruz), and are more than 13,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedra_Museo Piedra Museo]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1480 the [[Inca Empire]] conquered northwestern Argentina, making it part of the empire. In the northeastern area, the [[Guaraní]] developed a culture based on [[yuca]] and [[sweet potato]] however typical dishes all around Argentina are pasta, red wines (Italian influence) and beef.

Other languages spoken are Italian, English and German. Lunfardo is Argentinean slang and is a mix of Spanish and Italian. Argentineans are said to speak Spanish with an Italian accent.

== Politics ==
Argentina is a [[federal republic]]. The people of Argentina vote for a [[President]] to rule them and [[Senator]]s and [[Deputy|Deputies]] to speak for them and make laws for them. The President is [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] since December 2007.

== Administrative divisions ==
Argentina is divided into 23 [[province]]s (''provincias''; singular: ''provincia''), and 1 city (commonly known as ''capital federal''):

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Argentina}}
[[File:Argentina - Político.png|260px|thumb|left|alt=Map of Argentina|Map of Argentina]]

Argentina is almost 3,700&amp;nbsp;km long from north to south, and 1,400&amp;nbsp;km from east to west (maximum values). It can be divided into three parts: the [[Pampas]] in the central part of the country, [[Patagonia]] in the southern part down to [[Tierra del Fuego]]; and the [[Andes]] [[mountain range]] along the western border with [[Chile]], with the highest point in the province of [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]]. [[Cerro Aconcagua]], at 6,960 metres (22,834 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]), is the [[Americas|Americas']] highest mountain.

The most important rivers include the [[Rio de la Plata|River Plate]], [[Paraguay River|Paraguay]], [[Bermejo River|Bermejo]], [[Colorado River (Argentina)|Colorado]], [[Uruguay River|Uruguay]] and the largest river, the [[Paraná River|Paraná]]. River Plate was incorrectly translated though, and should have been translated to English as River of (the) Silver. River Plate is also a famous Buenos Aires soccer team.

See [[List of cities in Argentina]] for the many places people live in Argentina.

== Other information ==
The majority of the Argentineans are descendants of Europeans mainly from [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Ireland]], [[France]], other Europeans countries and [[Mestizo]] representing more than 90% of the total population of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html World Factbook]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Football in Argentina|Football]] or soccer is the most popular sport, although the national sport of the country is [[Pato]]. Argentina has a number of highly-ranked [[Polo]] players. Field hockey (for women) rugby and golf are also favorites.

Argentina is a [[Christian]] country. Most of Argentina's people (80 percent) are [[Roman Catholic]], but it is not the state religion&lt;ref&gt;http://biblioteca.idict.villaclara.cu/biblioteca/colecciones-culturales/lit-argentina/argentina/poblacion/religion&lt;/ref&gt;. Argentina also has the largest population of Jewish community after Israel and US. Many Middle Eastern immigrants who were Muslims converted to Catholicism, but there are still Muslims as well.

Medicine is socialized and so is education, making Argentina's literacy rate about 98%. State University is free as well.

'''Austria''' ({{lang-de|Österreich}}; officially called '''Republic of Austria'''), is a country in [[Western Europe]]. Around Austria there are [[Germany]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovenia]], [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Liechtenstein]]. Currently, the chancellor is [[Werner Faymann]]. Austria has been a [[state|member-state]] of the [[European Union|EU]] since [[1995]].

The people in Austria speak [[German language|German]], a few also [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. The capital of Austria is [[Vienna]] (Wien).

Austria is more than a thousand years old. Its history can be followed to the [[ninth century]]. At that time the first people moved to the land now known as Austria. The name &quot;Ostarrichi&quot; is first written in an official document from [[996]]. Since then this word has developed into the Modern German word ''Österreich''.

Austria is a democratic state and has nine federal states ({{lang-de|''Bundesländer''}}): [[Vorarlberg]], the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], [[Salzburg]], [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[Styria]], [[Upper Austria]], [[Lower Austria]], [[Vienna]] and [[Burgenland]]. It is a [[neutral]] state, that means it does not take part in wars with other countries. Austria has been in the [[United Nations]] since 1955 and in the [[European Union]] since 1995.

== History ==
=== Ancient times ===
There has been human settlement in the area that is now Austria for a long time. The first settlers go back to the Paleolithic age. That was the time of the [[Neanderthal]]s. They left works of art such as the [[Venus of Willendorf]]. In the Neolithic age people were living there to dig for [[mineral]] resources, especially [[copper]]. [[Ötzi the Iceman|Ötzi]], a [[mummy]] found in a [[glacier]] between Austria and Italy, is from that time. In the [[Bronze Age]] people built bigger settlements and fortresses, especially where there were [[mineral]] resources. [[Salt mine|Salt mining]] began near [[Hallstatt]]. At that time, [[Celt]]s began to form the first states.

=== The Romans ===
[[File:Austria Romana.png|left|thumb|Map]]
====The Roman cities and their modern names====
The Romans came 15 B.C. to Austria and made the Celtic Regnum Noricum to a province. Modern Austria was part of three provinces, Raetia, Noricum and Pannonia. The border in the north was the Danube.

=== Modern times ===
Austria was the [[Austrian Empire]] from about 800 to [[1918]] and was ruled by The House of [[Habsburg]] for most of that period. Then it became a [[republic]]. The ''First Republic'' was from 1918 to 1938. From 1938 to 1945 Austria was part of Germany. The ''Second Republic'' was started in 1945.

== Geography ==
{{see also|List of settlements in Austria}}
[[File:Au-map.png|thumb|left|150px|Map of Austria]]
Austria is a largely [[mountain]]ous country since it is partially in the [[Alps]]. The high mountainous Alps in the west of Austria flatten somewhat into low lands and plains in the east of the country where the [[Danube]] flows.

== Culture ==
=== Music and Arts ===
Many famous composers were Austrians or born in Austria.

'''Armenia''' (officially called the '''Republic of Armenia''') is a country in Asia. Its [[capital (city)|capital city]] is [[Yerevan]]. Armenia received its independence from the [[Soviet Union]] in [[1991]].

Armenia touches [[Turkey]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]], and [[Iran]].

There are some minorities living in Armenia, such as [[Greece|Greek]], [[Russia]]n, and other minorities, and more than 90% of the people are ethnic [[Armenians]].  Also, the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], is by far the largest religion in the country. There is a small amount of other [[Christians]], [[Muslims]] and [[atheists]].

Armenia is the place that some Christians believe [[Noah's Ark]] landed, and Noah's family settled.  The Armenian name for Armenia (Hayastan) means Land of Haik.  Haik was the name of a great-great-grandson of [[Noah]].

Throughout history, Armenia's size has changed many times.  Today Armenia is much smaller than it was once. In 80 BC, the Kingdom of Armenia covered parts of what is today Turkey, [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], Azerbaijan, and, of course, Armenia.

From [[1920]] to [[1991]], Armenia was a member of the [[Soviet Union]].

Today, Armenia's borders are locked with [[Turkey]] and [[Azerbaijan]], due to conflicts. In 1992, Armenia and Azerbaijan had a war over the land of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]. The fighting stopped in 1994, and Armenia has had control over this land, but Azerbaijan still disputes about the land.

== Geography ==
Armenia is [[landlocked country|landlocked]] in the [[Transcaucasus|South Caucasus]]. It is between the [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Caspian Sea]]s. The country is bordered on the north and east by [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]], and on the south and west by [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]].

It covers an area of {{convert|29743|km2|sqmi|0}}. The land is mostly mountains, with fast flowing rivers and few forests. There are hot summers and cold winters. 

[[Mount Ararat]] used to be part of Armenia. It is the highest mountain in the region. It is now in Turkey, but clearly visible in Armenia. The Armenians see it as a [[symbol]] of their land. Because of this, the mountain is present on the [[Coat of arms of Armenia|Armenian national emblem]] today.

== Provinces ==
Armenia is divided into ten [[provinces]] and the capital city of [[Yerevan]].  As of 2007, Armenia includes 915 communities.  49 are considered [[urban]] and 866 are considered [[rural]].  For a list of communities see [[List of settlements in Armenia]].

'''Archaeology''' is the study of the [[past]] by looking for the remains and artifacts ([[history|historical things]]) left by the people who lived long ago. These remains can include old [[coin]]s, [[tool]]s, [[building]]s, and [[garbage]]. Archaeologists, the people who study archaeology, use these remains to understand how people lived.

Archaeologists think it is important to understand the past, because so many people use the past to know where they come from. 

==Fieldwork==
When archaeologists do fieldwork, they look for remains, often by digging deep in the ground. When things are found, or even when nothing is found, the results of the fieldwork are taken back to the place where the archaeologist's base is, maybe a [[university]] or [[museum]]. They record everything they found by writing down on paper or entering the information into a computer, so that they can build a picture of everything that is found. As [[Human settlement|settlements]] (places where people lived in groups) change and grow, old buildings are often buried to make space for new buildings. Ancient [[Rome]], for example, is now up to 40 feet (12 metres) below the present city. This is why archaeological fieldwork is expensive and why it takes a long time.

==Fields of interest==
[[Archaeologist]]s do not all study the same [[civilization]]s, they specialize in different areas of interest. Some fields of interest include [[Ancient Egypt]] (these specialists are called [[Egyptologist]]s), [[Ancient Greece]], or the [[Vikings]]. Archaeologists study every [[civilization]] that is known, especially the ones where there is no written [[history]]. They can study any time period. For example, one might study the beginning of human life in Africa, or one might study [[World War II]]. Some archaeologists study things that are now underwater. They search for [[shipwreck|sunken ships]] or [[city|cities]] that have been lost under the sea.
 
==Sites==
[[Stonehenge]], in [[England]] is a famous archaeological site, or place. Other famous sites include [[Angkor Wat]], [[Machu Picchu]], and [[Great Zimbabwe]]. In many countries, [[government]]s and other groups of people protect important sites so that they will not be destroyed and so that visitors can always come and see them.

Sometimes archaeological sites are found when [[foundation]]s are dug for new [[building]]s. Archaeologists have to work quickly when this happens, because people building often don't have a lot of time. Many times as soon as the archaeologists are done with their work, the remains that they have found will be covered over, unless they are very important.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The word '''application''' has several uses.

*In [[medicine]], 'application' means putting some [[drug]] or [[ointment]] usually on the [[skin]] where it is absorbed into the [[human body]].

*In [[computer software]], an application is a type of [[computer program|program]] which is designed for a particular [[wikt:simple:function|function]]. Example: [[word processing]].
 
*In [[business]] or [[government]], an application is a (usually [[paper]]) [[form]] filled out and handed in by a person seeking a [[wikt:privilege|privilege]] from a [[state]] or [[company]], such as [[Employment|work]], [[credit]], some type of [[license]] or [[permit]], or a [[house|place to live]].

*At work, generally [[engineering]], when dealing with certain [[material]]s or [[wikt:object|objects]], an &quot;application&quot; is a [[wikt:purpose|purpose]] that material or object can be used for. [[Wood]] and [[steel]] have many applications.

The '''animal''' [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], or '''Animalia''', contains living things which do not use [[light]] to get [[energy]] and [[growth|grow]], as [[plants]] do. The study of animals is called [[zoology]].&lt;ref&gt;Ville C.A; Walker W.F. &amp; Barnes R.D. 1984. ''General zoology''. Saunders&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Gina. ''Kingdoms of life – Animals''. Lorenz Educational Press. ISBN 978-1-4291-1610-7&lt;/ref&gt;

In one way or another, animals get their energy from other living things. They usually eat other living things, but some are  [[parasitism|parasites]], or have [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[protist]]s as [[symbiosis|symbionts]]. 

Like plants, animals are [[multicellular]] [[eukaryotic]] organisms, but animals are [[motile]], meaning they can move around. Animals take in [[oxygen]], and give out [[carbon dioxide]]. This is part of their [[metabolism]] (chemical working). In both these  ways they are different from [[plants]]. Also, the cells of animals have different [[cell membrane]]s to other eukaryotes like plants and [[fungi]].

== Grouping animals ==
There are many types of animals. The common animals most people know are only about 3% of the animal kingdom. When [[biologists]] look at animals, they find things that certain animals have in common. They use this to group the animals in a [[biological classification]].

Animals can mainly be divided into two main groups, the [[invertebrate]]s, and the [[vertebrate]]s. The vertebrates are animals with a [[backbone]], or [[spine]], and the invertebrates without.   

Vertebrates are:
*[[fish]] (or 'fishes': both ways are correct)
*[[amphibian]]s
*[[reptile]]s
*[[bird]]s
*[[mammal]]s

Some invertebrates are:
*[[insect]]s
*[[spider]]s
*[[crustacean]]s
*[[mollusc]]s (like [[squid]])
*[[worm]]s
*[[jellyfish]]

== Life styles ==
The animal mode of [[nutrition]] is called [[heterotroph|heterotrophic]] because they get their food from other living organisms. Some animals eat only plants; they are called [[herbivore]]s. Other animals eat only [[meat]] and are called [[carnivore]]s. Animals that eat both plants and meat are called [[omnivore]]s.   

The [[environments]] animals live in varies greatly. By the process of [[evolution]], animals get [[adapted]] to the [[habitats]] they live in. Obviously, a [[fish]] is adapted to its life in water, and a [[spider]] is adapted to a life catching and eating insects. A [[mammal]] living on the [[savannah]]s of [[East Africa]] lives quite a different life from a mammal like a [[porpoise]] catching fish in the sea.

The fossil record of animals goes back about 600 million years to the [[Ediacaran]] period. During the whole of this long period of time animals have been constantly changing, so that the animals alive on Earth today are very different from those on the edges of the sea-floor in the Ediacaran. The study of ancient life is called [[palaeontology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Acceleration''' is a [[measure]] of how [[speed|fast]] [[velocity]] [[wikt:change|changes]]. Acceleration is the change of velocity [[Division (mathematics)|divide]]d by the change of [[time]]. Acceleration is a [[vector]], and therefore includes both a [[size]] and a [[direction]].
 
== Examples ==
* An object was moving [[north]] at 10 meters per second. The object speeds up and now is moving north at 15 [[meter]]s per [[second]]. The object has accelerated. 
* An [[apple]] is falling down. It starts falling at 0 meters per second. At the end of the first second, the apple is moving at 9.8 meters per second. The apple has accelerated. At the end of the second second, the apple is moving down at 19.6 meters per second. The apple has accelerated again.
* Jane is walking [[east]] at 3 [[kilometer]]s per [[hour]]. Jane's velocity does not change. Jane's acceleration is [[zero]]. 
* Tom was walking east at 3 kilometers per hour. Tom turns and walks [[south]] at 3 kilometers per hour. Tom has had a nonzero acceleration. 
* Sally was walking east at 3 kilometers per hour. Sally slows down. After, Sally walks east at 1.5 kilometers per hour. Sally has had a nonzero acceleration.
* [[Acceleration due to gravity]]

== Finding acceleration ==

Acceleration is the [[rate (mathematics)|rate]] of change of the [[velocity]] of an object. Acceleration &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{{a}}&lt;/math&gt; can be found by using:&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{{a}} = {\mathbf{v_1} - \mathbf{v_0} \over { t_1 - t_0 }}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_0}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity at the start
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_1}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity at the end
:&lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is the time at the start 
:&lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; is the time at the end 

Sometimes the change in velocity &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v_1} - \mathbf{v_0}&lt;/math&gt; is written as Δ&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;. Sometimes the change in time &lt;math&gt;{ t_1 - t_0 }&lt;/math&gt; is written as Δt.

In difficult situations, the acceleration can be calculated using [[mathematics]]: in [[calculus]], acceleration is the [[Derivative (mathematics)|derivative]] of the velocity (with respect to time), &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Units of measurement ===
Acceleration has its own [[units of measurement]]. For example, if velocity is measured in meters per second, and if time is measured in seconds, then acceleration is measured in meters per second squared  (m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

=== Other words ===
Acceleration can be [[positive]] or [[negative number|negative]]. When the acceleration is negative (but the velocity does not change direction), it is sometimes called deceleration. For example, when a car brakes it decelerates. Physicists usually only use the word &quot;acceleration&quot;.

== Newton's second law of motion ==
Newton's laws of motion are [[rule]]s for how things [[Movement|move]]. These rules are called &quot;[[law]]s of [[motion (physics)|motion]]&quot;. [[Isaac Newton]] is the [[scientist]] who first wrote down the main laws of motion.
According to [[Newton's laws of motion#Second Law|Newton's Second Law of Motion]], the [[Force (physics)|force]] something needs to accelerate an object depends on the object's [[mass]] (the amount of &quot;stuff&quot; the object is made from or how &quot;heavy&quot; it is).
The formula of Newton's Second Law of Motion is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the force, and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; the mass. 
This formula is very well-known, and it is very important in [[physics]]. Newton's Second Law of Motion, in short &quot;Newton's Second Law&quot;, is often one of the first things that physics students learn.

== Deceleration ==
Deceleration is the opposite of acceleration. This means that something slows down instead of speeding up. For example, when a car brakes, it is decelerating.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Black pudding''' is an English name for blood sausage.  It is [[food]] made by [[cooking]] down the [[blood]] of any [[mammal]] (usually [[pig]]s or cattle) with meat, fat or filler until it is thick enough to [[congealing|congeal]] (become firm or solid) when cooled.

==Types of Black pudding==
[[File:Blutwurst.jpg|thumb|German ''Blutwurst'']]
In [[England]] blood sausage is called  ''Black Pudding''. The ingredients include pig's blood, [[suet]], [[bread]], [[barley]] and [[oats|oatmeal]]. The most common kind of German ''blutwurst'' is made from fatty pork meat, beef blood and filler such as barley. Though already cooked and &quot;ready to eat&quot; it is usually served warm.

Other kinds of blood sausage include ''boudin noir'' (France), ''boudin rouge'' ([[Creole]] and [[Cajun]]) and ''morcilla'' (Spain).

==History==
A [[legend]] says that blood sausage was invented in a [[gambling|bet]] between two [[Bavarian]] [[butcher]]s drunk on the alcoholic drink [[absinthe]] during the [[14th century]]. [[Homer]]'s ''Odyssey'' from Ancient [[Greece]] says that &quot;As when a man besides a great fire has filled a sausage with fat and blood and turns it this way and that and is very eager to get it quickly roasted...&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''boot device''' is used to start a [[computer]].  It is named after a [[boot]] which fits on the [[foot]].  The word [[bootstrap]] is also closely related, and means, to use something simpler to get something more complex to make itself work better. It comes from the English phrase &quot;pull yourself up by your own bootstraps.&quot;

Before a computer can operate normally, it must have [[operating system]] instructions that tell it how to perform basic functions.  A boot device loads the operating system into the [[memory]] of the computer. 

Devices that can boot a computer are usually '''boot disks''' or '''boot drives''' 
(normally a [[hard drive]], but can be a [[floppy disk]] or a [[compact disk|CD]]).  Some [[network computer]]s use ''boot chips'' that get the [[operating system]] over a [[network]].  [[Web phone]]s also use such chips to identify the user to the [[cell network]].  '''Boot card''' standards may let many users boot [[kiosk computer]]s with full [[privacy]] and access to all [[applications]] they own. There are also '''boot boards''' or '''boot ''add-in'' cards''' that are more permanent than boot cards.

Some people refer to the boot device as just a '''boot''' and non-boot devices as '''data device'''s, although it is not the [[computer]] but the [[operating system]] that cares about the difference between these.

==Origin==
The boot in '''boot device''' is the same as [[booting]] (or starting up). This is short for bootstrapping, or to start with simple stuff and make complex stuff out of it.

[[File:Wooden boots-Sanita-lightblue.jpg|thumb|100px|right]]
A '''boot''' is a type of [[footwear]] that protects the [[foot]] and [[ankle]]. Boots are higher and larger than [[shoe]]s and [[sandal]]s. Some boots are high enough to protect the [[leg|calves]] (lower part of the leg) as well.  Some boots are held on with ''bootstraps'' or ''bootlaces''.  Some also have '''spats''' or ''gaiters'' to keep water out.  Most have a very strong ''boot sole'', the bottom part of a boot.

== Types of boots ==
* '''Rain boots''' (or rubber boots) are made from [[rubber]] or [[plastic]]. Rain boots protect a person's feet from [[water]] and [[rain]]. People who work on [[fishing]] boats and [[farmer]]s wear rubber boots to keep their feet dry. People who work in [[chemical industry|chemical]] factories wear rubber boots to protect their feet from dangerous chemicals.

* '''Winter boots''' are boots that keep a person's feet warm in cold weather. People in cold countries such as [[Canada]] and [[Sweden]] wear winter boots during the cold season. Winter boots can be made from many different materials, such as [[leather]], [[fabric]], or [[plastic]]. Winter boots are [[thermal insulation|insulated]] with wool or fur to keep the feet warm. Most winter boots also keep people's feet dry.

* '''Work boots''' (or &quot;[[construction]] boots&quot;) are designed for people who work in construction or [[factory]] jobs. Work boots often have a steel toe cover to protect the person's toes. Work boots are usually made of strong leather, to protect the person's foot from sharp objects or dangerous chemicals. Some work boots have a flat piece of [[steel]] in the sole to protect the foot from sharp [[nail]]s. Many countries require construction workers to wear work boots when they are on a construction site.

== Other meanings ==
People in English-speaking countries refer to boots in a figurative or [[joke|joking]] manner when they tell someone &quot;to lift yourself up by your own bootstraps&quot;.  This is a joke because it is impossible for someone to lift themselves up by their own bootstraps. What the person is really saying is &quot;figure out your problem yourself&quot; or &quot;find your own way to better your situation.&quot;

As well, people sometimes use the term '''to bootstrap'''. This is an [[idiom]] meaning &quot;to use something simpler to get something more complex to make itself work better.&quot; The word [[Booting|&quot;boot&quot;]] is also used to describe how a [[computer]] starts up when a person presses the &quot;on&quot; button. 

Another term &quot;To boot&quot; is an [[idiom]] meaning [[wikt:also|also]].  For example, people say &quot;he had a beer, and a whiskey to boot.&quot; This means that the person had a beer, and also had a glass of whiskey. Another [[slang]] use of the word &quot;boot&quot; is to say &quot;Fred got the boot from the company.&quot; This means that Fred got [[unemployment|fired]] from the company.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bancruptcy''' is when someone or an organisation does not have enough [[money]] to pay all of its [[debt]] is insolvent. If it applies for protection by [[law]] it may then be '''bankrupt'''.  

In many countries a [[company]] or [[business]] can &quot;file for [[bankruptcy protection]]&quot; so that [[creditor]]s cannot destroy all of the [[physical capital]] and [[goodwill]] by breaking it apart and moving it away.  All this provides is more [[time]] to work out a new [[deal]] between the owners and the people the business owes money.

An individual person who owes debt and cannot pay it can also &quot;declare bankruptcy&quot;.  That person will lose all but some basic things they [[own]], but all the debt will go away.  Normally they cannot easily borrow money again for years.

Very often, a [[creditor]] threatens a [[debtor]] with [[debt slavery]], if the debtor does not know that they have a right to go '''bankrupt'''.  This is a [[human rights]] problem in very many countries. Also, some creditors continue to bother a debtor even though bankruptcy laws say they should not, hoping that the debtor will pay them money they might not otherwise get.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Breakfast sausage''' is a type of fresh [[pork]] [[sausage]] made from [[season]]ed [[ground]] [[meat]] mixed with [[bread]] crumbs. Breakfast sausage has a blander flavor than many other types of sausage, such as Polish or Italian-style sausages.

==Using breakfast sausages==
Breakfast sausages are not [[curing|cured]] or [[smoking|smoked]] like other types of sausages, which means that they have to be cooked soon after they are purchased (unless they are frozen).  Uncooked sausages should be stored in the [[refrigerator]] or the [[Refrigerator|freezer]]. Individuals handling them should wash their hands in hot [[soap]]y water, because uncooked pork is unhealthy for humans. Pork sausages have to be heated until all of the meat inside is cooked. 

They are usually [[Frying|fried]] or grilled in a pan until they are browned and served at [[breakfast]], often with cooked [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[pancake]]s, and [[toast]]ed bread. Breakfast sausages are also used in other dishes, such as &quot;toad in the hole&quot; a cooked batter dish.

==Types of breakfast sausages==
Different types made from pork and [[beef]] mixtures as well as [[poultry]] can now be found. There are also [[vegetarian]] types that use [[tofu|textured vegetable protein]] in place of meat. Breakfast sausages are available in patties or slices from a large roll, or in weiner-like links of different lengths and thickness.

A '''browser''' is an animal, usually a [[herbivorous]] [[mammal]], which eats [[leaves]] and [[shrub]]s rather than [[grass]]. It is contrasted with [[grazer]]s, which eat grass.

'''Beekeeping''' or '''apiculture''' is the [[farming]] of [[honeybee]]s.

== Uses ==
The keeping of bees is usually, and has been in the past, for [[honey]]. That is becoming less true. Instead, it is more used for [[crop]] [[pollination]] and other products. These are [[:wikt:wax|wax]] and [[propolis]]. 

There is only one queen bee in each hive and she is bigger than the rest. She lays all the eggs, which makes all the other bees in the hive her daughters and sons. However, they do not control the hive.

== Types of beekeeping ==
The largest beekeeping operations are agricultural businesses that are operated for profit. Some people also have small beekeeping operations that they do as a [[hobby]]. Urban beekeeping is a growing trend, and some have found that &quot;city bees&quot; are actually healthier than &quot;rural bees&quot; because there are fewer pesticides and greater biodiversity&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jun/23/can-cities-save-bees&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Threats==
[[Colony Collapse Disorder]] is a growing problem, along with [[mite]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''British English''' is the kind of [[English language]] which is used in the [[United Kingdom]] and countries that used to be in the [[British Empire]].

== Pronunciation in British English ==
In the United Kingdom, many different people say words in different ways. For example: a man from a place near [[London]] may not say his &quot;r&quot;s the same as a man from [[Scotland]] or a man from [[Northern Ireland]]. In fact, people's languages are different across the UK, depending on the area you are in. For example, in [[Wales]] one might speak [[Welsh language|Welsh]] or in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Irish language|Irish]] (although the Republic of Ireland is not part of the UK). Across the country the accent is different. For instance in [[Liverpool]] one speaks with a &quot;scouse&quot; accent or in [[London]] one speaks with a &quot;cockney&quot; accent. Different variations on all of British English exist from the manner in which words are pronounced to the manner in which they are spelt. One place people speak English in a different way is [[Cornwall]], where the [[Cornish dialect]] is spoken. 

== Spelling in British English ==
British English often keeps more traditional ways of spelling words than American English. 

* Some British English words end in &quot;re&quot; that are often simplified to &quot;er&quot; in American English.
::British English: centre, litre, metre.
::American English: center, liter, meter.
* Some British English words end in &quot;our&quot; and are simplified to &quot;or&quot; in American English.
::British English: colour, favour, honour, labour
::American English: color, favor, honor, labor
* Some British English words the have come originally from the Greek language use &quot;ph&quot;. This has been changed to &quot;f&quot; in some other languages.
::British English: Sulphur, not Sulfur
* Some words in British English use &quot;s&quot; where &quot;z&quot; is used in American English.
::British English: colonisation, realisation, organisation
::American English: colonization, realization, organization
* The word &quot;[[gray]]&quot; is also a special case, as it can be spelled &quot;gray&quot; in American English and &quot;grey&quot; in British English.
* Many of these rules are also used in other countries outside of the [[United Kingdom]], mostly in countries that are members in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

== Vocabulary in British English ==
In British English, &quot;dock&quot; refers to the [[water]] in the space between two &quot;piers&quot; or &quot;wharfs&quot;. In American English, the &quot;pier&quot; or &quot;wharf&quot; could be called a &quot;dock&quot;, and the water between would be a &quot;slip&quot;.

Some simpler differences:

British – American
* accelerator – throttle
* [[autumn]] – fall
* [[biscuit]] – cookie
* bonnet – hood (of a car)
* [[boot]] – trunk (of a car)
* bum, arse – butt, ass
* [[car]] – automobile
* caravan – trailer, mobile home
* chips – [[French fries]]
* courgette – [[zucchini]]
* crisps – chips
* face flannel – washcloth
* flat – apartment
* [[football (soccer)|football]] – soccer
* garden – yard
* handbag – purse
* jumper – sweater
* [[lift]] – elevator
* lorry – truck
* manual gearbox – stick shift
* metro, underground, tube – subway
* motorway – freeway
* mum – mom
* nappy – diaper

== Usage in different countries ==
British English, when referring to globally Commonwealth English, is a official Language in every English speaking country excluding The United States of America. [[American English]] is only a official language in The United States of America and Canada (less common, due to British Influence). Although Commonwealth English is the most spoken, American English is seen more often over the internet, due to the very large population, and large internet prone population. All [[Commonwealth Nations]] including Europe and Africa learn Commonwealth English, while American English is often learnt in the Americas (excluding commonwealth nations) and China. Z pronounced 'Zee' is only seen in the U.S.A and less commonly in Canada, while Z pronounced 'Zed' is spoken almost everywhere else. The United Kingdom and Ireland use British Layout Keyboards, while Australia, South Africa, Canada, New Zealand and the U.S.A use American Layout Keyboards.

:''Being is also a [[present tense]] part of [[to be]]''

The word '''being''' means the same as &quot;person&quot;. [[man|Men]], [[woman|women]], and [[child]]ren are [[human being]]s.

Some people write stories or make [[movie]]s about beings from other [[planet]]s. Most [[religion]]s talk about [[supernatural]] beings, for example [[spirit]]s, [[angel]]s, [[devil]]s, [[deity|gods]], or [[God]].

Being is something THAT IS.

[[File:Beijing Financial Street (overlook).jpg|thumb|Beijing]]

'''Beijing''' ({{lang-zh|北京}} /Běijīng/) is the [[Capital (city)|capital]] of the [[People's Republic of China]]. The city used to be known as '''''Peking'''''.  It is in the northern and eastern parts of the country.

The city of Beijing has played a very important role in the development of China. Many people from different cities and countries come to Beijing to look for better chances to find work. Nearly 15 million people live there. In 2008 Beijing hosted the [[Olympic Games]].

Beijing is well known for its ancient history.  Since the [[Jin Dynasty]], Beijing has been the [[Capital (city)|capital]] of several [[dynasties]], including the Yuan, Ming, Qing, and others.  There are many places of historic interest in Beijing.  These places include the [[Summer Palace]] (Yiheyuan), the Temple of Heaven (Tiantan), and the [[Great Wall of China]] (Changcheng).

== What This Means==
Beijing means &quot;the northern capital&quot; in the [[Chinese language]].  It was once a counterpart of [[Nanjing]], &quot;the southern capital&quot;, during the Ming Dynasty.  This dynasty gave Beijing its name.  When the city does not serve as the capital city, the city reverts to its original name of Beiping, &quot;northern peace&quot;; this occurred between 1928 and 1949 when Nanjing was the capital of the Republic of China.

== History ==
The center of Beijing was settled in the [[1st millennium BC]]. In those days, the Kingdom of Yan (燕) set up their capital where Beijing is today.&lt;ref name=&quot;CD History&quot;&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.city-data.com/world-cities/Beijing-History.html |title=History - Beijing |accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They called it Ji (蓟). After the Kingdom of Yan was destroyed, the city became smaller, although it was still an important place.

Beijing became more important again in the 10th century, when the Jin dynasty set its capital there. This city was destroyed by [[Mongol]] forces in [[1215]].  Then in [[1267]], Mongols built a new city on the north side of the Jin capital, and called it &quot;Great Capital&quot; (大都, Dadu), which was the beginning of modern Beijing. When [[Kublai Khan]] the Mongolian monarch, set up the Yuan dynasty, this city became his capital.

The [[Yuan Dynasty]], [[Ming Dynasty]] and [[Qing dynasty]] all made Beijing their capital. When the Qing dynasty lost power and the Republic of China was set up, the new Republic moved its capital from Beijing to Nanjing. When the People's Republic of China seized power, Beijing became the capital of China again.

In 1989, there were [[protest]]s in [[Tiananmen Square|Tian'anmen Square]] because some people wanted [[democracy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CD History&quot; /&gt;

== Education ==
Beijing is the education center of People's Republic of China. More 500 famous universities of China are in Beijing.  They also  include 5 of the top universities: Peking University, Tsinghua University, China People University, Beijing Normal University and Beihang University. Beijing is also education center of China for teaching Chinese as a foreign language. The standard Chinese pronunciation is based on Beijing dialect, so over 70% foreigners who want to study Chinese go to Beijing for their studies.

The word '''berry''' is used for many different kinds of small [[fruit]]s that have many [[seeds]] and can be used as food. Some examples are [[raspberry]], [[blueberry]] and [[lingonberry]].

When [[botany|botanists]] talk about ''berries'', they mean a simple [[fruit]] produced from a single [[gynoecium|ovary]]. They sometimes call this ''true berry'', to distinguish it from ''false berries''. By that statement of how words are used, [[grape]]s or [[tomato]]es are true berries.

The berry is the most common type of soft fruit in which the entire ovary wall gets to the right stage of development of the [[pericarp]] which can be taken as food. The flowers of these plants have a upper ovary with one or more [[carpels]]. The seeds are inside the soft body of the ovary.

Berries are small, sweet, liquid, bright colored fruits. Due to this, they are able to bring more [[animal]]s towards them and spread their [[seed]]s.

Some fruits that are called ''berries'' in [[English language|English]] are not ''true berries'' by the use of words above. These include [[strawberry|strawberries]], [[blackberry|blackberries]], [[raspberry|raspberries]] and [[boysenberry|boysenberries]]. Some true berries do not have ''berry'' in their name. These include [[tomato]]es, [[eggplants]], [[cranberries]], [[guava]]s, [[pomegranate]]s and [[chile pepper|chillies]]. [[Pumpkin]]s, [[cucumber]]s, [[melon]]s, [[orange (fruit)|oranges]] and [[lemon]]s are also berries that have slightly different structure and may be called by different names ([[pepo]] for pumpkins, cucumbers, and melons, or [[hesperidium]] for oranges and lemons).

A '''beard''' is the [[hair]] growing on the lower part of a [[man]]'s [[face]].

The hair that grows on the upper [[lip]] of some men is a [[mustache]].  When a man has hair only below the lower lip and above the chin, it is called a [[soul patch]].  Some men have a lot of hair and a big beard, and some have very little. In the modern world, many men [[shave]] part or all of their beards, or cut their beard so it does not get very long. 

Some [[animal]]s also have hair like this, and people sometimes also call this hair a '''beard'''.

In light, '''black''' is lack of all [[color]].  In [[painting]], however, the black [[pigment]] is the combination of all colors.  In [[heraldry]], black is called &quot;sable&quot;.

==Origin of ''black''==
The word black comes from Old English blæc (&quot;black, dark&quot;, also, &quot;ink&quot;), from Proto-Germanic *blakkaz (&quot;burned&quot;), and from Proto-Indo-European *bhleg-. In many languages, ''black'' has the same meaning as ''ink''.

==Black in science==
In science, an object that is black absorbs the light that hits it. Because these objects do not reflect any light, the human [[eye]] can't see any color coming from that object. The [[brain]] then sees these objects as black.


A way to create black objects is to mix [[pigment|pigments]]. A pigment works by reflecting only the color of the pigment. For example, a blue pigment absorbs all colors except blue. By mixing pigments in the right quantities, black can be made.


Because black objects absorb light, they become warmer faster.

== Meaning of black ==

Black is associated with power, elegance, formality, [[anarchy]], death, evil, and mystery. Black is a dark color, the darkest color there is. Black, along with gray and white, is a ''neutral'' color. This means that it is not a ''hot'' color or a ''cool'' color.

Black is a color seen with fear and the unknown (black holes). It can have a bad meaning (blacklist, 'black death', black cat) or a good meaning ('in the black', 'black is beautiful'). Black can stand for strength and power. It can be a [[formal]], elegant, and high-class color (black tie, black Mercedes, black taco, black people). Black clothing is common in [[emo]] and [[goth subculture]].

'''Bubonic plague''' is the best-known form of the disease [[plague]], which is caused by the [[bacterium]] [[Yersinia pestis]]. The name ''bubonic plague'' is specific for this form of the disease, which enters through the skin, and travels through the [[lymphatic system]]. 

If the disease is left untreated, it kills about half its victims, in between three and seven days. The bubonic plague was the disease that caused the [[Black Death]], which killed tens of millions of people in Europe, in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/03/0310_040310_blackdeath.html|title=Bubonic Plague Traced to Ancient Egypt|first=Cameron|last=Walker|publisher=National Geographic News|date=10 March, 2004|accessdate=2 April, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Symptom]]s of this disease include [[cough]]ing, [[fever]], and black spots on the [[skin]]. 

== Different kinds of the same disease ==
There are different kinds of Bubonic plague. The most common form of the disease is spread by a certain kind of [[flea]], that lives on [[rat]]s. Then there is an [[incubation period]] which can last from a few hours to about seven days. 
=== [[Septicemic plague]] ===
[[Sepsis]] happens when the bacterium enters the [[blood]] and make it form tiny clots.
=== [[Pneumonic]] plague ===
This happens when the bacterium can enter the lungs. About 95% of all people with this form will die. Incubation period is only one to two days.

=== The abortive form ===
This is the most harmless form. It will result in a little [[fever]]. After that, there are [[antibody|antibodies]] that protect against all forms for a long time.

== History ==
During the 1300s, this [[epidemic]] struck parts of [[Asia]], [[North Africa]], and [[Europe]]. Almost a third of the people in Europe died of it. Unlike [[catastrophe]]s that pull communities together, this epidemic was so terrifying that it broke people's trust in one another. [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], an [[Italy|Italian]] writer of the time, described it: ''&quot;This [[scourge]] had implanted so great a terror in the hearts of men and women that brothers [[abandon]]ed brothers, uncles their nephews, sisters their brothers, and in many cases wives deserted their husbands. But even worse,... fathers and mothers refused to nurse and assist their own children.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;The decameron / Giovanni Boccaccio ; translated by Mark Musa &amp; Peter Bondanella ; with an introduction by Thomas G. Bergin. ISBN 0-451-52866-2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transmission ==
[[File:Flea infected with yersinia pestis.jpg|thumb|[[Oriental rat flea]] (''Xenopsylla cheopis'') infected with the ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' [[Bacteria|bacterium]] which appears as a dark mass in the gut. The foregut of this flea is blocked by a Y. pestis [[biofilm]]; when the flea attempts to feed on an uninfected [[Host (biology)|host]] ''Y. pestis'' from the foregut is [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitated]] into the wound, causing [[infection]].]]
The plague was not just carried by [[rat]]s as some people assume. The [[flea]]s also carried it. It came abroad from [[Kaffa]] by the [[Black Sea]]. From there the disease started to go new places in [[1347]]. It went to [[England]] in [[1349]]. There it killed '''half''' of the people in England. 70% of people who got plague died. Pigs are also to blame for the transmission, as the bacteria stayed in their blood system, and when eaten, people caught the plague. This is a reason why so few Jews or Muslims caught the disease.

== Modern history ==
In the [[20th century]], some countries did [[research]] on the [[bacteria]] that causes bubonic plague. They did research to use it for [[biological warfare]].

Samples of this [[bacteria]] are carefully controlled. There is much [[paranoia]] (fear) about it. Dr. Thomas C. Butler, a [[United States|US]] expert in this [[organism]] was charged in October [[2003]] by the [[FBI]] with various [[crime]]s. This happened after he said he lost samples of ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''. This is the bacteria that causes bubonic plague. The FBI did not find the samples. They do not know what happened to them.

'''Biology''' is the [[science]] of life and living things, and their  [[evolution]]. Living things include [[plants]], [[animals]], [[fungi]] (such as [[mushroom]]s), and [[microorganisms]] such as [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. 

People who study biology are called biologists. Biology looks at how animals and other organisms behave and work, and what they are like. Biology also studies how [[organism]]s react with each other and the [[environment]]. It has existed as a [[science]] for about 200 years, and was preceded by [[natural history]]. Biology has many [[research]] fields and [[branch]]es. Like all sciences, biology uses the [[scientific method]]. This means that biologists must be able to show [[evidence]] for their ideas, and that other biologists must be able to test the ideas for themselves. 

Biology attempts to answer questions such as:
&quot;What are the characteristics of this living thing?&quot; ([[comparative anatomy]]);
&quot;How do the parts work?&quot; ([[physiology]]);
&quot;How should we group living things?&quot; ([[classification]], [[taxonomy]]); 
&quot;What does this living thing do?&quot; ([[behaviour]], [[growth]]);
&quot;How does [[inheritance]] work? ([[genetics]]); &quot;What has been the history of life?&quot; ([[palaeontology]]). How do organisms relate to their [[environment]]? ([[ecology]]). All modern biology is influenced by [[evolution]], which answers the question: &quot;How has the living world come to be as it is?&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Botany''' is the study of [[plants]]. It is a [[science]]. It is a branch of [[biology]], and is also called plant biology. It is sometimes called phytology. Scientists who study botany are called botanists. They study how plants work.

== Branches of Botany ==

== Notable botanists ==
*[[Ibn al-Baitar]] (d. 1248), Andalusian-Arab scientist, botanist, pharmacist, physician, and author of one of the largest botanical encyclopedias.
*[[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] (1707–1788) was a French naturalist who held the position of Intendant of the ''Jardin du Roi'' ('King's Garden'). Buffon published thirty-five volumes of his ''Histoire naturelle'' during his lifetime, and nine more volumes were published after his death.
*[[Luther Burbank]] (1849–1926), American botanist, horticulturist, and a pioneer in agricultural science.
*[[Charles Darwin]] (1809–1882) wrote eight important books on botany after he published the ''Origin of Species''.
*[[Al-Dinawari]] (828–896), Kurdish botanist, historian, geographer, astronomer, mathematician, and founder of [[Arabic botany]].
*[[Conrad Gessner]] (1516–1565) was a [[Swiss]] naturalist and bibliographer. 
*[[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] (1817–1911), English botanist and explorer. Second winner of [[Darwin Medal]].
*[[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707–1778), Swedish botanist, physician and zoologist who laid the foundations for the modern scheme of Binomial nomenclature. He is known as the father of modern taxonomy, and is also considered one of the fathers of modern ecology.
*[[Gregor Mendel]] (1822–1884), Augustinian priest and scientist, and is often called the father of [[genetics]] for his study of the inheritance of traits in pea plants.
*[[John Ray]] (1627–1705) was an English naturalist, the father of English natural history.
*[[G. Ledyard Stebbins]] (1906–2000) was an American botanist and geneticist. He was one of the leading evolutionary biologists of the 20th century.
*[[Eduard Strasburger]] (1844–1912) was a Polish-German professor who was one of the most famous botanists of the 19th century.
*[[Nikolai Vavilov]] (1887–1943) was a Russian botanist and geneticist. He  showed how and where crop plants evolved. He studied and improved wheat, corn, and other cereal crops.

'''Belgium''', officially the '''Kingdom of Belgium''', is a [[Federation|federal]] [[sovereign state|state]] in Western Europe. It is a founding member of the [[European Union]]. It has the headquarters of the [[European Union]], [[NATO]] and some other famous organisations. The [[capital city]] of Belgium is [[Brussels]].  Belgium has an area of {{convert|30528|km2|sqmi}}.  There are about 11&amp;nbsp;million people.

There are three [[region]]s in Belgium: [[Flanders]] (where the [[Flemish people|Flemish]] speak [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) in the northern half of Belgium, [[Wallonia]] (where most people speak [[French language|French]]) in the southern half and the [[Brussels]]-Capital Region in the middle (where French is mostly spoken, with some Dutch).

The population is about 60% Dutch-speaking and 39% French-speaking, with a few German-speaking towns on the border with [[Germany]]. To look after both groups, Belgium has a complicated system of government.

==History==
[[File:Map-1477 Low Countries.png|thumb|left|The [[Seventeen Provinces]] (orange, brown and yellow areas) and the [[Bishopric of Liège]] (green)]]

The name 'Belgium' comes from ''[[Gallia Belgica]]''.  This was a [[Roman province]] in the northernmost part of [[Gaul]].  Before Roman invasion in 100&amp;nbsp;BC,  the ''[[Belgae]]'', a mix of [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Germanic peoples]], lived there.&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of the Roman Empire]] |author=Bunson, Matthew

A slow shift of power during the 8th century led the kingdom of the Franks to change into the [[Carolingian Empire]].&lt;ref name=CookP3&gt; Cook (2002), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843 divided the region into [[Middle Francia|Middle]] and [[West Francia]]. They were [[vassal]]s either of the [[King of France]] or of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]].&lt;ref name=CookP3/&gt;

The [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568–1648) divided the Low Countries into the northern [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] and the [[Southern Netherlands]].  Southern Netherlands were ruled by the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] and the [[Austria]]n [[Habsburg]]s.  This made up most of modern Belgium. 

After the [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1794|campaigns of 1794 in the French Revolutionary Wars]], the Low Countries were added into the [[French First Republic]].  This ended Austrian rule in the area. Adding back the Low Countries formed the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]].  This happened at the end of the [[First French Empire]] in 1815.

The [[Belgian Revolution]] was in 1830. &lt;ref name=Dobbelaere-VoyE&gt; {{Cite journal |url = http://socrel.oxfordjournals.org/content/51/Special_Issue/S1.full.pdf |title = From Pillar to Postmodernity: The Changing Situation of Religion in Belgium |page = S1 |publisher = ([http://www-oxford.op.org/allen/about.htm The Allen Review]).

The [[Berlin Conference]] of 1885 gave control of the [[Congo Free State]] to [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold&amp;nbsp;II]]. This was for him personally and not for the country of Belgium.  Starting in about 1900 many people did not like how he treated the Congolese people. In 1908 the Belgian state took control of the colony.  It was then called the [[Belgian Congo]].&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite book |title=The State of Africa |pages=95–96(?) |edition=Hardcover 608pp |date=6 June 2005 |author=Meredith, Mark |publisher=Free Press

Germany invaded Belgium in 1914. This was part of World War&amp;nbsp;I. The opening months of the war were very bad in Belgium. During the war Belgium took over the of [[Ruanda-Urundi]] (modern day [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]). After the First World War, the [[districts of Prussia|Prussian districts]] of [[Eupen-Malmedy|Eupen and Malmedy]] were added into Belgium in 1925. [[Battle of Belgium|The country was again invaded by Germany in 1940]] and under German control until 1944. After World War&amp;nbsp;II, the people made king [[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold&amp;nbsp;III]] leave his throne in 1951. This is because they thought he helped the Germans.   

In 1960 the Belgian Congo stopped being under Belgian rule.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1304803 |title=The Congolese Civil War 1960–1964 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=29 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later Ruanda-Urundi also became free. Belgium joined [[NATO]] as a founding member. 

== Government and Politics ==
[[File:Prince Philippe of Belgium, Duke of Brabant cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Philippe of Belgium]], current King.]]
Belgium has a system of [[government]] known as a [[constitutional monarchy]], meaning that it has a [[monarch]], but that the monarch does not rule the country, and that a government is elected [[Democracy|democratically]].

Belgium has had its own monarchy since 1831. King [[Albert II of Belgium|Albert II]] left the throne on July 21, 2013 and the current king is [[Philippe of Belgium|Philippe]].

In Belgium, the government is elected. Between mid-2010 and late 2011, after no clear result in the [[election]], Belgium had no official government, until [[Elio Di Rupo]] became [[Prime Minister]]. [[Flanders]] and [[Wallonia]] both also have their own regional governments, and there is a notable independence movement in Flanders.

== Geography ==
{{see also|List of cities in Belgium}}

Belgium is next to [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Netherlands]]. Its total area is 33,990 [[square kilometers]].  The land area alone is 30,528&amp;nbsp;km². Belgium has three main geographical regions. The coastal plain is in the north-west. The central plateau are part of the Anglo-Belgian Basin. The [[Ardennes]] uplands are in the south-east. The Paris Basin reaches a small fourth area at Belgium's southernmost tip, Belgian Lorraine.

The coastal plain is mostly [[sand dune]]s and [[polder]]s. Further inland is a smooth, slowly rising landscape.  There are fertile [[valley]]s. The hills have many [[forest]]s. The [[plateau]]s of the Ardennes are more rough and rocky.  They have caves and small, narrow valleys. Signal de Botrange is the country's highest point at 694 metres (2,277&amp;nbsp;ft).

===Provinces===
Belgium is divided into three Regions.  [[Flemish Region|Flanders]] and [[Walloon Region|Wallonia]] are divided into [[province]]s.  The third Region, [[Brussels Capital Region|Brussels]] is not part of any province.

'''Brazil''' (officially called '''Federative Republic of Brazil'''; how to say: {{IPA2|bɾɐˈziw}}) is a [[country]] in [[South America]]. It is the [[earth|world]]'s fifth largest country. The country has about 201 million people. The [[capital (city)|capital]] of Brazil is [[Brasília]].

== History ==
The first people to come to Brazil came around 9,000 B.C. That group of people is often called the South American Indians.  They probably came from [[North America]]. Some of them were hunters and gatherers, but others were farmers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://school.eb.com/levels/high/article/106094 |title=Brazil |website=Britannica School |publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica |accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] was the first European to see Brazil. He saw it in 1500. He was from [[Portugal]] and the Portuguese government claimed Brazil. Soon, explorers explored the whole coastline of Brazil and colonies were set up. In the late 1500s and early 1600s the Dutch and the French would sometimes try to take land in Brazil. Brazilians started moving inland farther than the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] said they could. This caused some fights with the Spaniards and native people in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot; /&gt;

In 1822, Brazil claimed to be its own country and not a part of [[Portugal]] anymore. Soon there was [[civil war]]. But the emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] improved the economy, and in 1888, he freed the [[slavery|slaves]]. In 1889, there was a military [[coup]] and Pedro II had to leave the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot; /&gt;

In 1889, Brazil became a [[republic]]. It was not very democratic, because the only people who could vote where people who owned land. There were some uprisings in the 1920s because some people thought the government was unfairly helping coffee growers. Brazil joined the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot; /&gt;

During the 1960s, the leader [[Castelo Branco]] made the government like a [[dictatorship]]. Since then, the country has become more democratic, but some people feel that there are still big problems in health and education.

==Languages==
Most people in Brazil speak [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. Brazil is the only country in Latin America that speaks [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

Some people in Brazil speak [[German language|German]] dialects. That came from German immigrants. 0.8% of Brazilians speak German as their [[first language]].

Other people in Brazil speak indigenous Brazilian languages, [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[French language|French]], or [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]] and [[Aymara language|Aymará]] are the first languages of a small number of Brazilians.

== Geography ==
Brazil has the world's largest [[rainforest]], the [[Amazon Rainforest]]. It makes up 40% of the country's land area. Brazil also has other types of land, including a type of [[savanna]] called ''cerrado'', and a dry plant region named ''caatinga''.

The most important cities are [[Brasília]] (the capital), [[Belém (Brazil)|Belém]], [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Curitiba]], [[Florianópolis]], [[Fortaleza (Brazil)|Fortaleza]], [[Goiânia]], [[Manaus]], [[Porto Alegre]],  [[Recife]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[São Paulo]] (the biggest city) and [[Vitória (Brazil)|Vitória]].  Other cities are at [[List of largest cities in Brazil]].

Brazil is divided into 26 states plus the Federal District in five regions (north, south, northeast, southeast and centre-west):
*'''North''': Acre, Amazonas, Rondônia, Roraima, Pará, Amapá, Tocantins
*'''Northeast''': Maranhão, Pernambuco, Ceará, Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba, Alagoas, Sergipe, Bahia
*'''Centre-West''': Goiás, Mato grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Distrito Federal/ Federal District
*'''Southeast''': São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais
*'''South''': Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul

The country is the fifth largest in the world by area. It is known for its many rainforests and jungles. It is next to every country in South America except [[Chile]] and [[Ecuador]].

== People/culture ==

Brazil is the largest country in [[South America]] and the largest economy in [[Latin America]]. Its people include people of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] or other [[Europe]]an descent, [[Africa]]n descent, and [[Indigenous peoples|native Amerindians]], as well as many people of [[Mulatto|mixed origins]]. Brazil also has the biggest number of [[Japan]]ese descendents outside Japan. 

People from Brazil are called ''Brazilians''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=brazilian |title=WordNet Search - 3.0 |work=wordnetweb.princeton.edu |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''brasileiros'' in Brazilian Portuguese language).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Chemicals in flasks.jpg|thumb|200px|Chemistry is the science of ''chemical elements'' and ''compounds''.]]
'''Chemistry''' is the [[science]] of [[chemical element]]s and [[Chemical compound|compounds]], and how these things work together. It is the study of the [[material]]s (things) that make up our bodies and everything in the world around us.

==History==
Before 1600, people studied substances to figure out how to do things such as turn lead into gold, but no one managed to do that. This was called alchemy. Alchemists (people that did alchemy) did discover some useful things, though. Sulphuric acid and nitric acid were two substances that they discovered.
Only a few elements were known. Some of them are mercury, silver, gold, and carbon.

Chemistry began as a true science during the 1600s. This is when chemists discovered the simplest [[substance]]s that make up all other substances. These simple substances are called elements. One of the things that they learned is that gold and lead are two different elements, so you can not change one into the other by a chemical reaction. The first element discovered after 1600 was [[phosphorus]], a strange white glowing solid.

Elements were discovered more and more rapidly. People separated the air into many parts and isolated the [[noble gas]]es from it. They also processed special minerals from a mine in [[Sweden]] to get [[rare earth metal]]s. [[Radioactivity]] was also discovered. Today chemists have discovered 118 different elements. Some are very common, like [[oxygen]]. Many are very rare and expensive, like [[platinum]]. Some cannot be found on earth and can only be made in labs, like [[rutherfordium]].

Since the 1920s, the increased understanding of [[physics]] has changed chemists' [[theory|theories]] about [[chemical reaction]]s.  With smaller and faster [[computer]]s, chemists have built better tools for [[Analytical chemistry|analyzing]] substances. These tools have been sent to study chemicals on [[Mars]].  Police also use those tools to study [[evidence]] from [[crime]] [[wikt:scene|scene]]s.

==Types of chemistry==
There are several types of chemistry. [[Analytical chemistry]] looks at which chemicals are in things. For example, looking at how much [[arsenic]] is in food. [[Organic chemistry]] looks at things that have [[carbon]] in them. For example, making [[acetylene]]. [[Inorganic chemistry]] looks at things that do not have carbon in them. One example is making an [[integrated circuit]].

A large area of chemistry is [[polymer chemistry]]. This looks at plastics. One example is making [[nylon]]. Because plastics are made of carbon, polymer chemistry is part of organic chemistry. Another area is [[biochemistry]]. This looks at the chemistry of living things. An example would be seeing how [[arsenic]] poisons people. Biochemistry is also part of organic chemistry. There are many other small branches of chemistry.

==[[wikt:concept|Concepts]] of chemistry==
===Basic concepts===
The basic unit of an [[Chemical element|element]] is called an [[atom]]. An atom is the smallest building block that you can cut an element into without the element breaking down (turning into a lighter element, for example through [[nuclear fission]] or [[radioactive decay]]). A [[chemical compound]] is a [[substance]] made up of two or more elements. In a compound, two or more atoms are joined together to form a [[molecule]]. The tiniest speck of dust or drop of [[liquid]], that one can see is made up of many millions or billions of these molecules. [[Mixture]]s are [[substance]]s where chemicals are mixed but not reacted. An example would be mixing sand and salt. This can be undone again to produce salt and sand separately. Chemical compounds are changed by a chemical reaction. An example would be heating [[sodium bicarbonate]], common baking soda. It will make water, [[carbon dioxide]], and [[sodium carbonate]]. This reaction cannot be undone.

===Mole===
A mole is a very large amount of atoms (602,214,150,000,000,000,000,000 atoms). The [[atomic mass]] of an element can be used to see how much of the element makes a mole. For example, the atomic mass of copper is about 63.55. That means about 63.55 [[gram]]s of copper metal has a mole of atoms. The atomic mass of chlorine is about 35.45. That means 35.45 grams of chlorine has a mole of atoms in it.

Moles can be used to see how many molecules are in chemical compounds, too. [[Copper(II) chloride]] is an example. CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is its chemical formula. There is one copper atom (63.55) and two chlorine atoms (35.45 · 2 = 70.90). Add all the molar masses of the elements together and the molar mass of the chemical compound is gotten. (63.55 + 70.90 = 134.45) That means in 134.45 grams of copper(II) chloride, there is one mole of copper(II) chloride molecules. This concept is used to calculate how much chemicals are needed in a chemical reaction if no reactants (chemicals that are reacted) should be left. If too much reactant is used, there will be some reactants left in the chemical reaction.

===Acids and bases===
[[Acid]]s and [[base (chemistry)|bases]] are common chemicals. Acids release H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; [[ion]]s when in water, and bases release [[Hydroxide|OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]] ions when in water. Acids can react with bases. The H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is taken from the acid by the base. This makes water, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. A salt is also made when an acid and a base react together. An example would be reacting [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) and [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH). Hydrochloric acid releases H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions in water. The base releases Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions. The H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and the OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; react to make water. There is a solution of [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl) left. Sodium chloride is a [[salt]]. 

==Usefulness==
Chemistry is very useful in everyday life and makes up the foundation of many branches of science. Most objects are made by chemists (people who do chemistry). Chemists are constantly working to find new and useful substances. Chemists make new [[Medicine|drugs]] and materials like [[paint]]s that we use every day.

==Safety==
[[File:Cyril Ponnamperuma analyzing a moon sample.jpg|thumb|200px|This chemist is wearing safety [[glasses]], a lab coat and [[glove]]s. He is looking at a rock from the [[moon]].]]
Many chemicals are harmless, but there are some chemicals that are dangerous. For example, [[mercury(II) chloride]] is very [[wikt:toxic|toxic]]. [[Chromate]]s can cause [[cancer]]. [[Tin(II) chloride]] pollutes water easily. [[Hydrochloric acid]] can cause bad burns. Some chemicals like [[hydrogen]] can explode or catch fire. To stay safe, chemists experiment with chemicals in a chemical lab. They use special equipment and clothing to do reactions and keep the chemicals contained. The chemicals used in [[Medicine|drugs]] and in things like [[bleach]] have been tested to make sure they are safe if used correctly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Computer science''' is the study of how to manipulate, manage, transform and [[encode]] [[information]]. 

There are many different areas in computer science. Some of the areas consider problems in a more [[wikt:abstract|abstract]] way. Some areas need special [[machine]]s, called [[computer]]s.

A person who works with computers will often need [[mathematics]], [[science]], and [[logic]] in order to make and use computers.

== Common tasks for a computer scientist ==
=== Asking questions ===
This is so that they can find new and easier ways to do things, and the way to approach problems with this information.

=== Asking the right question ===
Computers can do some things easily (for example: simple math, or sorting out a list of names from A-to-Z). Computers cannot do some things, though. Computers cannot answer questions when there is not enough information, or when there is no real answer. Also, computers may take too much time to finish long [[wikt:task|tasks]]. For example, it may take too long to find the shortest way through all of the towns in the USA - so instead a computer will try to make a [[heuristic|close guess]]. A computer will answer these simpler questions much faster.

=== Answering the question ===
[[Algorithm]]s are steps of instructions describing how to complete a task, such as solving a problem. Think about [[playing cards]], for example. A computer scientist wants to sort the cards. First he wants to sort them out by color. Then he wants to order them by number (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace). The computer scientist may see different ways to sort the playing cards. He must now think about of how he will do it. When he decides, he has created an algorithm. After making the algorithm, the scientist needs to test whether the algorithm always does what it should. Then, the scientist can see how well his program sorts the cards.

A simple but very slow algorithm could be: drop the cards, pick them up, and check whether they are sorted. If they are not, do it again. This method will work, but it will often take a very long time. The name of this sorting algorithm is Bogosort.
 
A person may do this better by looking through all the cards, finding the first card (2 of diamonds), and putting it at the start. After this, he looks for the second card, and so on. This works much faster, and does not need much space. The name of this sorting algorithm is selection sort.

Computer science began during [[World War II]] and separated from the other sciences during the 1960's and 1970's. Now, computer science uses special methods of doing things, and has its own special words. It is related to [[electrical engineering]], [[mathematics]], and [[language science]].

Computer science looks at the [[theory|theoretical]] parts of computers. [[Computer engineering]] looks at the physical [[computer hardware|parts]] of computers (the parts that a person can touch), and [[software engineering]] looks at the use of [[software|computer programs]] and how to make them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If Wikipedia does not work at all, go to the [http://openfacts.berlios.de/index-en.phtml?title=Wikipedia_Status Wikipedia Status page on OpenFacts]. That page will tell you what is wrong and the [[developer]]s will say if they are fixing it. You could also check '''IRC''': #wikipedia on irc.freenode.net for when Wikipedia is closed for repairs. 

If you want to change Wikipedia, there is a page on OpenFacts where you can write Wikipedia pages and then move them here when Wikipedia is fixed.

If you only want to learn something at Wikipedia, '''[[Google]]''' keeps a copy of one version of every Wikipedia page (except redirect pages, but including pages resulting from redirects). Since Google checks the contents of pages once every one or two months, the saved version may not be the latest. Also, neither older versions are kept, nor the revision history listing. Thus, through Google one can still read and search the contents of Wikipedia, albeit not always the latest content; see below.

You can also visit sites which run fixed copies of Wikipedia whilst Wikipedia is down or visit the [[SchoolsWP:index:home|Wikipedia Selection for Schools]] which runs on a different machine. A fuller list of fixed copies is available at the open facts site listed above. 

== Google search of Wikipedia ==
By following the link below, you can use the [[Google]] search engine to search the English Wikipedia. Google keeps a copy of all namespaces and all language Wikipedias. When you find the page you want listed by google you need to click on &quot;cached&quot; to see the copy of the whole page.

Google updates its index about once a month, the search is based on the contents at that time!

The search is based on the text the browser shows, not on the source text which is seen in the Wikipedia edit box.

Using Google to search Wikipedia is faster. After finding an article, one can choose to view the current version or the cached one.  The cached version may not be the same as the current version on Wikipedia, but it is faster to view and is always available.

[http://www.google.com/custom?sa=Google+Search&amp;domains=wikipedia.org&amp;sitesearch=wikipedia.org Use Google to search Wikipedia]

It also searches many other language versions (those also on wikipedia.org), including Dutch, German and French, but not those on wikipedia.com, which include Afrikaans, Frisian, Italian and Simple English.

[[File:Computer-aj aj ashton 01.svg|thumb|A drawing of a usual desktop computer.]]
A '''computer''' is a [[machine]] that is able to take information ([[input]]), do some work on or make changes to the information, to make new information ([[output]]). Computers have existed for much of [[human]] [[history]]. Examples of early computers are the [[astrolabe]] and the [[abacus]]. 

Modern computers are very different from early computers. They are now very powerful machines that are able to do billions of calculations every second.   Most people have used a [[personal computer]] in their home or at work.  Computers are useful for many different jobs where automatic tasks are useful.  Some examples are controlling [[traffic light]]s, [[vehicle]] computers, security systems, [[Washing machines]] and Digital Televisions.

A person (called a user) can control a computer by telling it to do things.  Some ways of controlling a computer are with a [[keyboard (computer)|keyboard]], [[computer mouse | mouse]], buttons, [[touch screen]].  Some very new computers can also be controlled with voice commands or hand gestures.  

Computers can be designed to do anything with information.  Computers are used to control factories, which in the past were controlled by humans. They are also in homes, where they are used for things such as listening to music, reading the news, and writing.

Modern computers are electronic machines. A computer is only useful if it has both hardware and software.  Hardware is the physical parts the computer is made of - for example keyboard, mouse, screen, tower, and the circuits inside it.   Software is the computer programs (mathematical instructions). The software uses the hardware, when the user gives it instructions and changing it in to useful output.  

Many modern computers do billions of calculations each second.   They do mathematical [[arithmetic]] very quickly but computers do not really &quot;think&quot;.  They only follow the instructions in their software programs. 

Computer programs are designed or written by computer [[programmer]]s. A few programmers write programs in the computer's own language called [[machine code]]. Machine Code has only a few instructions and is based on [[logic]] and Mathematical arithmetic.  Using machine code is difficult for most human programmers. 

Today, programs are commonly written using a [[programming language]] like [[C++]], [[Java programming language|Java]], and [[Objective-C]].  These programming languages are more like the language you talk and write with every day. A program called a [[compiler]] translates the user's instructions into binary code (machine code) and turns it into useful information that a user can easily understand, and then the computer will understand the instructions and do what is needed.

== History of computers ==
[[File:Jacquard.loom.full.view.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Jacquard loom]] was one of the first programmable devices.]]

=== Definition ===
A computer is an electronic machine which helps solving problems quickly and easily.It solves problems according to instructions given to it by the computer user.

=== Invention ===

Nobody knows who built the first computer. This is because the word &quot;computer&quot; used to mean a person who did maths as their job (a human computer).  Because of this, some people say that humans were the first computers. Human computers got bored doing the same maths over and over again, and made tools (mostly mechanical calculating devices like [[abacus]]es) to help them get the answers to their problems. It is said that the inventor of the 'modern' computer was Charles Babbage.

=== Automation ===

Humans have a problem with maths.  To show this, try doing 584 x 3,220 in your head.  It is hard to remember all the steps!  People made tools to help them remember where they were in a maths problem. The other problem people have is that they have to do the same problem over and over and over again.  A cashier used to make change every day in her head or with a piece of paper.  That took a lot of time and people made mistakes.  So people made machines that did those same things over and over. This part of computer history is called the &quot;history of automated calculation,&quot; which is a fancy phrase for &quot;the history of machines that make it easy for me to do this same maths problem over and over without making mistakes.&quot;

The [[abacus]], the [[slide rule]],  the [[astrolabe]] and the [[Antikythera mechanism]] (which dates from about 150-100 BC) are examples of automated calculation machines.

=== Programming ===
{{main|Computer programming}}
Some people did not want a machine that would do the same thing over and over again. For example, a music box is a machine that plays the same music over and over again. Some people wanted to be able to tell their machine to do different things. For example, they wanted to tell the music box to play different music every time. They wanted to be able to program the music box- to order the music box to play different music. This part of computer history is called the &quot;history of programmable machines&quot; which is a fancy phrase for &quot;The history of machines that I can order to do different things if I know how to speak their language.&quot;

One of the first examples of this was built by [[Hero of Alexandria]] (c. 10–70 AD). He built a mechanical theater which performed a play lasting 10 minutes and was operated by a complex system of ropes and drums. These ropes and drums were the language of the machine- they told what the machine did and when. Some people argue that this is the first programmable machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Most historians agree that the &quot;castle clock&quot;, an [[astronomical clock]] invented by [[Al-Jazari]] in 1206, is the first known [[Computer programming|programmable]] [[analog computer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ancient Discoveries&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=[[Ancient Discoveries]], Episode 11: Ancient Robots|publisher=[[History Channel]]|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxjbaQl0ad8|accessdate=2008-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It showed the [[zodiac]], the [[Heliocentric orbit|solar]] and [[lunar orbit]]s, a [[Lunar phase|crescent moon]]-shaped [[Pointer (computing)|pointer]] travelling across a gateway that made some [[door]]s to open every [[hour]],&lt;ref&gt;Howard R.

=== The Computing Era ===

At the end of the [[Middle Ages]], people in Europe thought math and [[engineering]] were more important. In 1623, [[Wilhelm Schickard]] made a mechanical calculator.  Other Europeans made more calculators after him.  They were not modern computers because they could only add, subtract, and multiply- you could not change what they did to make them do something like play Tetris.  Because of this, we say they were not programmable. 

In 1801, [[Joseph Marie Jacquard]] used [[punch card|punched paper cards]] to tell his [[loom|textile loom]] what kind of pattern to weave. He could use punch cards to tell the loom what to do, and he could change the punch cards, which means he could program the loom to weave the pattern he wanted.  This means the loom was programmable. 

Modern computers were made when someone ([[Charles Babbage]]) had an idea.  He wanted to make a machine that could do all the boring parts of math, (like the automated calculators) and could be told to do them different ways (like the programmable machines.)  [[Charles Babbage]] was the first to make a design of a fully programmable mechanical computer. He called it the &quot;The [[Analytical engine|Analytical Engine]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Don't confuse the Analytical Engine with Babbage's [[difference engine]] which was a non-programmable mechanical calculator.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Babbage did not have enough money and always changed his design when he had a better idea, he never built his Analytical Engine.

As time went on, computers got more and more popular.  And that stands out at the beginning. This is because people get bored easily doing the same thing over and over.  Imagine spending your life writing things down on index cards, storing them, and then having to go find them again.  The U.S. Census Bureau in 1890 had hundreds of people doing just that. People got very bored and very frustrated, and would say, &quot;There HAS to be an easier way to do this.&quot; Then a clever person worked out how to make machines do a lot of the work. [[Herman Hollerith]] figured out how to make a machine that would automatically add up information that the Census bureau collected. The [[Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation]](which later became [[IBM]]) made his machines, and everyone was happy. At least, they were happy until their machines broke down, got jammed, and had to be repaired. This is when the [[Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation]] invented tech support.  

Because of machines like this, new ways of talking to these machines were invented, and new types of machines were invented, and eventually the computer as we know it was born.

== Analog and Digital Computers ==

In the first half of the 20th century, scientists started using computers, mostly because scientists had a lot of math to figure out and wanted to spend more of their time thinking about the secrets of the universe instead of spending hours adding numbers together. For example, if they had to launch a [[rocket ship]], they needed to do a lot of math to make sure the rocket did not blow up.

So they put together computers. These computers used [[analog signal|analog]] circuits, which made them very hard to program. Then, in the 1930s, they invented [[digital]] computers, which made them easier to program.  

=== High-scale computers ===

Scientists figured out how to make and use digital computers in the 1930s and 1940s.  Scientists made a lot of digital computers, and as they did, they figured out how to ask them the right sorts of questions to get the most out of them.  Here are a few of the computers they built: 

{{Early computer characteristics}}

[[File:EDSAC (10).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[EDSAC]] was one of the first computers that remembered what you told it even after you turned the power off.  This is called ([[von Neumann architecture|von Neumann]]) architecture.]]
* [[Konrad Zuse]]'s [[Electromechanics|electromechanical]] &quot;Z machines&quot;. The [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] (1941) was the first working machine that used [[Binary numeral system|binary]] arithmetic.  Binary arithmetic means using &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No.&quot; to add numbers together.  You could also program it.  In 1998 the Z3 was proved to be [[Turing complete]].  Turing complete means that it is possible to tell this particular computer anything that it is mathematically possible to tell a computer.  It is the world's first modern computer.
* The non-programmable [[Atanasoff–Berry Computer]] (1941) which used vacuum tubes to store &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; answers, and [[regenerative capacitor memory]].

* The [[Harvard Mark I]] (1944), A big computer that you could kind of program.
* The U.S. Army's [[Ballistics Research Laboratory]] [[ENIAC]] (1946), which could add numbers the way people do (using the numbers 0 through 9) and is sometimes called the first general purpose [[Electronics|electronic]] computer (since [[Konrad Zuse]]'s [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] of 1941 used [[electromagnets]] instead of [[electronics]]). At first, however, the only way you could reprogram ENIAC was by rewiring it.

Several developers of ENIAC saw its problems. They invented a way to for a computer to remember what they had told it, and a way to change what it remembered. This is known as &quot;stored program architecture&quot; or [[von Neumann architecture]]. [[John von Neumann]] talked about this design in the paper ''[[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]]'', distributed in 1945. A number of projects to develop computers based on the stored-program architecture started around this time.  The first of these was completed in [[Great Britain]]. The first to be demonstrated working was the [[Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine]] (SSEM or &quot;Baby&quot;), while the [[EDSAC]], completed a year after SSEM, was the first really useful computer that used the stored program design. Shortly afterwards, the machine originally described by von Neumann's paper—[[EDVAC]]—was completed but was not ready for two years.

Nearly all modern computers use the stored-program architecture in some form. It has become the main [[concept]] which defines a modern computer. Most of the technologies used to build computers have changed since the 1940s, but many current computers still use the von-Neumann architecture.

[[File:80486dx2-large.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Microprocessor]]s are miniaturized devices that often implement stored program [[CPU]]s.]]

In the 1950's computers were built out of mostly [[vacuum tube]]s.  [[Transistors]] replaced vacuum tubes in the 1960's because they were smaller and cheaper.   They also need less power and do not break down as much as vacuum tubes. In the 1970s, technologies were based on [[integrated circuit]]s. [[Microprocessor]]s, such as the [[Intel 4004]] made computers smaller and cheaper. They also made computers faster and more reliable. By the 1980s, computers became small and cheap enough to replace mechanical controls in things like [[washing machine]]s. The 1980s also saw [[home computer]]s and [[personal computer]]. With the evolution of the [[Internet]], personal computers are becoming as common as the [[television]] and the [[telephone]] in the household.

In 2005 Nokia started to call some of its mobile phones (the N-series) &quot;multimedia computers&quot; and after the launch of the Apple [[iPhone]] in 2007, many are now starting to add the [[smartphone]] category among &quot;real&quot; computers. In 2008, if the category of smartphones are included in the numbers of computers in the world, the biggest computer maker by units sold, is no longer Hewlett-Packard, but rather Nokia.{{fact|date=December 2008}}

== Kinds of computers ==
There are six types of computers:  personal computers, mainframes, laptop computers, mini computers, super computers and embedded computers.  

A &quot;desktop computer&quot; is a small machine that has a screen (which is not part of the computer).  Most people keep them on top of a desk, which is why they are called &quot;desktop computers.&quot; &quot;[[Laptop]] computers&quot; are computers small enough to fit on your lap.  This makes them easy to carry around. Both laptops and desktops are called personal computers, because one person at a time uses them for things like playing music, surfing the web, or playing video games. 

There are bigger computers that many people at a time can use.  These are called &quot;Mainframes,&quot; and these computers do all the things that make things like the internet work. You can think of a personal computer like this:  the personal computer is like your skin:  you can see it, other people can see it, and through your skin you feel wind, water, air, and the rest of the world.  A mainframe is more like your internal organs: you (hopefully) never see them, and you barely even think about them, but if they suddenly went missing, you would have some very big problems.  

There is another type of computer, called an embedded computer.  An embedded computer is a computer that does one thing and one thing only, and usually does it very well.  For example, an alarm clock is a embedded computer:  it tells the time.  Unlike your personal computer, you cannot use your clock to play Tetris.  Because of this, we say that embedded computers cannot be programmed, because you cannot install programs like Tetris on your clock. Some [[mobile phone]]s, [[automatic teller machine]]s, [[microwave oven]]s, [[CD player]]s and [[car]]s are examples of embedded computers.

===All-in-one PC===
All-in-one computers are [[PC|desktop computers]] that have the [[CPU]] and [[Loudspeaker|speaker]] in the same case as the [[Computer monitor|monitor]]. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] has made several popular examples of all-in-one computers, such as the [[Macintosh 128K|original Macintosh]] of the mid-1980s and the [[iMac]] of the late 1990s and 2000s.

== Common uses of home computers ==
* Playing [[computer game]]s
* [[Writing]]
* Solving [[mathematics]]
* [[search engine | Looking]] for things on the [[Internet]]
* Watching [[TV]] and [[movies]]
* Listening to [[music]]
* [[Communication|Communicating]] with other people
* Downloading
* Sending [[e-mail]]
* Sorting
* Recording
* Calculating
* Editing
* Taking Pictures ([[photography]])
* Drawing
*

== Working methods ==
Computers store data and the instructions telling them what to do with the data as numbers, because computers can do things with numbers very quickly. These data are stored as [[binary]] [[symbol]]s (1s and 0s). A 1 or a 0 symbol stored by a computer is called a [[bit]], which comes from the words binary [[Numerical digit|digit]]. Computers can use many bits together to represent instructions and the data that these instructions use. A list of instructions is called a [[program]] and is stored on the computer's [[hard disk]]. Computers work through the program by using a [[central processing unit]], and they use fast memory called [[RAM]] as a space to store the instructions and data while they are doing this. When the computer wants to store the results of the program for later, it uses the [[hard disk]] because things stored on a hard disk can still be remembered after the computer is turned off.

An [[operating system]] tells the computer how to understand what jobs it has to do, how to do these jobs, and how to tell people the results. It tells the electronics inside the computer, or &quot;[[Computer hardware|hardware]]&quot;, how to work to get the results it needs. This lets most computers have the same [[operating system]], or list of orders to tell it how to talk to the user, while each computer can have its own computer programs or list of jobs to do what its user needs. Having different programs and [[operating system]]s makes it easy to learn how to use computers for new things. When a user needs to use a computer for something different, the user can learn how to use a new program.

== The Internet ==
One of the most important jobs that computers do for people is helping with [[communication]]. Communication is how people share [[information]]. Computers have helped people move forward in [[science]], [[medicine]], [[business]], and [[learning]], because they let experts from anywhere in the world work with each other and share information. They also let other [[wikt:people|people]] communicate with each other, do their jobs almost anywhere, learn about almost anything, or share their opinions with each other. The [[Internet]] is the thing that lets [[wikt:people|people]] communicate between their computers.

== Computers and waste ==
A computer is now almost always an [[electronic device]].  It usually contains materials that will become [[toxic waste]] when disposed of.  When a new computer is bought in some places, laws require that the cost of its [[waste management]] must also be paid for.  This is called [[product stewardship]].

Computers can become [[wikt:obsolete|obsolete]] quickly, depending on what programs the user runs.  Very often, they are thrown away within two or three years, because newer programs require a more powerful computer. This makes the problem worse, so [[computer recycling]] happens a lot.  Many projects try to send working computers to [[developing nation]]s so they can be re-used and will not become waste as quickly, as most people do not need to run new programs. Some computer parts, such as [[hard drive]]s, can break easily. When these parts end up in the [[landfill]], they can put [[poison]]ous chemicals like [[lead]] into the ground water. Hard drives can also contain secret information like [[credit card]] numbers. If the hard drive is not erased before being thrown away, an [[Identity theft|identity thief]] can get the information off of the hard drive, even if the drive doesn't work, and use it to steal money from the previous owner's bank account.

== Main hardware ==
Computers come in different forms, but most of them have a common design.
* All computers have a [[CPU]].
* All computers have some kind of [[data bus]] which lets them get inputs or output things to the environment.
* All computers have some form of memory. These are usually chips ([[integrated circuit]]s) which can hold information.
* Many computers have some kind of sensors, which lets them get input from their environment.
* Many computers have some kind of display device, which lets them show output. They may also have other [[peripheral equipment|peripheral devices]] connected.
 	
A computer has several main parts. When comparing a computer to a human body, the [[CPU]] is like a brain. It does most of the 'thinking' and tells the rest of the computer how to work. The CPU is on the Motherboard, which is like the skeleton. It provides the basis for where the other parts go, and carries the [[nerves]] that connect them to each other and the CPU. The motherboard is connected to a power supply, which provides [[electricity]] to the entire computer. The various drives ([[compact disc|CD]] drive,  [[floppy drive]], and on many newer computers, [[USB flash drive]]) act like eyes, ears, and fingers, and allow the computer to read different types of storage, in the same way that a human can read different types of books. The [[hard drive]] is like a human's memory, and keeps track of all the data stored on the computer. Most computers have a [[sound card]] or another method of making sound, which is like [[vocal cords]], or a voice box. Connected to the sound card are [[loudspeaker|speakers]], which are like a mouth, and are where the sound comes out. Computers might also have a [[graphics card]], which helps the computer to create visual effects, such as 3D environments, or more realistic colors, and more powerful graphics cards can make more realistic or more advanced images, in the same way a well trained artist can.

Chinese [[Writing]] does not use [[letters]].  It has 50,000 different characters, each made of different lines, called strokes.  It is writing system dated back over 5,000 years.  There are many Chinese [[dialect]]s (20 or more way of speaking), they are written in similiar characters or follow their dialect's pronunciation. 

Each line of Chinese is written starting at the top of the page working down.  The lines are written working from the right to the left of the page. However, some countries, like [[Singapore]] and [[Taiwan]], writes Chinese the same way as writing English.

There are two types of Chinese writing, Traditional and Simplified.

In People's Republic of China, most people do not write Traditional Chinese. The government enforces a simpler way of writing, known as Simplified Chinese, The popular way to use a computer [[Keyboard (computer)|keyboard]] to type Chinese is called [[Pinyin]]. The government of [[Taiwan]] enforces Traditional Chinese, The popular way to use a computer [[Keyboard (computer)|keyboard]] to type Traditional Chinese is called [[Bopomofo]].

Chinese writing can be written as a type of art, called [[calligraphy]], which means making [[art]] from writing.  Most calligraphy is written in Traditional Chinese, some calligraphy is written in Simplified Chinese.  This art is over 1,000 years old and many people today still practice it.

A '''continent''' is a large area of the [[land]] on [[Earth]] that is joined together. In general it is agreed there are seven continents: [[Africa]], [[Antarctica]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Australasia]] or [[Oceania]],&lt;ref&gt;Either are accepted terms&lt;/ref&gt; and [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/134805/continent Continent] (2009). In ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved 12 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NatlGeo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/places/continents/|title=Continents: What is a Continent?|publisher=[[National Geographic]]|accessdate=2009-08-22}} &quot;Most people recognize seven continents—Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia, from largest to smallest—although sometimes Europe and Asia are considered a single continent, Eurasia.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative versions ==
=== Australia ===
Some sources say that Australia is one of the seven continents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/as.html#Geo World fact book - Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; Others say that Australia is part of [[Oceania]].   [[Oceania]] is a region which includes [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[Pacific Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/au.htm Worldatlas.com - Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; The third alternative is the term [[Australasia]], which includes at least all countries on the Australian [[continental plate]]. This includes the islands of [[New Guinea]], [[Tasmania]], New Zealand and a number of smaller islands. It is on the south-eastern side of the [[Wallace Line]], with distinct differences in its biology from the Asian side of the line.

:&quot;It includes all the islands of the Malay Archipelago... as well as the various groups of islands in the Pacific. The term has been used in very different senses&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Alfred Russel 1893. ''Australasia'', vol 1. London: Stanford. Chapter 1: Definition.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North and South America ===
North America and South America are often described as &quot;the Americas&quot;. This has the advantage of including [[Central America]] and the [[Caribbean]] islands. Otherwise, Central America is counted as part of North America.

=== Eurasia ===
[[Eurasia]] is not really an alternative, it is a recognition that the landmass of Europe and Asia are continuous, and some of its largest countries are in both continents. [[Russia]] extends from eastern Europe to the far east of Asia without a break. The [[Ural Mountains]], which run roughly north/south, are the traditional dividing-line between Europe and Asia. For many purposes is is convenient to consider the great landmass as a single continent, Eurasia.

When [[Britain|British]] people talk about &quot;the Continent&quot; (or &quot;Continental&quot; things) they mean the [[Europe|European mainland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/continent.html |title=Encarta World English Dictionary |accessdate=2008-08-05 |year=2007|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing Plc.|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwRKDyZ6|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meaning is not used as much as it used to be, but is still seen in phrases like &quot;Continental [[breakfast]]&quot; ([[bread|rolls]] with [[cheese]], [[jam]] etc. as distinct from an &quot;English breakfast&quot; which is a cooked breakfast).

Continents not only move but also sometimes move against each other. The Indian subcontinent has been colliding with the Eurasian continent for a while now. As these continents push against each other, they buckle and bend. Because of this, the [[Himalaya Mountains]], where [[Mount Everest]] is, are still being made today.&lt;ref name=holt&gt;{{cite book | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Earth Science| publisher = Holt, Rinehart and Winston| date = 2001| location = United States of America| pages = 211| url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-03-055667-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Four elements representation.png|thumb|The four classical elements.]]

The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] '''classical elements''' are fire, air, water, and earth. In Greek [[philosophy]], [[science]] and [[medicine]], these make up a whole.

*Fire is both hot and dry.
*Air is both hot and wet.
*Water is both cold and wet.
*Earth is both cold and dry.

The image below has two squares on top of each other. The corners of one are the classical elements. The corners of the other are the properties.

[[Galen]] said these elements were used by [[Hippocrates]] to describe the human body. The elements are linked to the four humours: phlegm (water), yellow bile (fire), black bile (earth), and blood (air).

In [[China|Chinese]] [[Taoism]] the elements are [[metal]], [[wood]], [[water]], [[fire]], [[earth]] ({{lang|zh|金、木、水、火、土}}).

'''China''' ({{zh|t=中國;|s=中国)}}) is a [[Culture|cultural]] [[region]], an [[Ancient history|ancient]] [[civilization]], and a [[nation]] in [[East Asia]].

The last [[Chinese Civil War]] resulted in two nations:
* {{flagicon|China}} The ''[[People's Republic of China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]]'', commonly known as ''China'', has control over [[mainland China]] and the largely self-governing territories of [[Hong Kong]] (since 1997) and [[Macau]] (since 1999).
* {{flagicon|Taiwan}} The ''[[Republic of China|Republic of China (ROC)]]'', commonly known as ''[[Taiwan]]'', has control over the islands of [[Taiwan]], [[Penghu]], [[Fujian|Kinmen]], and Matsu.

China has one of the world's oldest civilizations and has the oldest continuous civilization.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emsc.nysed.gov/ciai/socst/grade3/whatisa.html&lt;/ref&gt; It has [[archaeology|archaeological]] [[evidence]] over 5,000 years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hagg&quot;&gt;Haggett, Peter. [2001] (2001). Encyclopedia of World Geography, Volume 23. Edition 2, illustrated. Marshall Cavendish publishing. ISBN 0-7614-7289-4, 9780761472896. p 37. p 2836.&lt;/ref&gt; It also has one of the world's oldest [[Chinese character|writing systems]], and is viewed as the source of many major [[inventions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hagg&quot; /&gt;

==Origins==
The first recorded use of the word &quot;China&quot; is dated 1555.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Eden, Richard. ''Decades of the New World'' (1555) 'The great China whose kyng is thought the greatest prince in the world.'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OnlineEty&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=china China]&quot;, ''Online Etymology Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from ''Cin'', a Persian name for China popularized in Europe by [[Marco Polo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OnlineEty&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood&quot;&gt;Wood, Francis, ''Did Marco Polo go to China'' (1995), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of China}}
[[Ancient China]] was one of the first [[civilization]]s and was active since the [[2nd millennium BC]] as a [[feudalism|feudal]] [[society]]. Chinese civilization was also one of the few to invent [[writing]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Hagg&quot; /&gt; the others being [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Indus Valley civilization]], the [[Maya civilization]], the [[Minoan civilization]] of [[ancient Greece]], and [[Ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Gernet, Jacques. [1996] (1996). A history of Chinese civilization Edition 2, illustrated. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-49781-7, 9780521497817. p 40.&lt;/ref&gt; It reached its golden age during the [[Tang Dynasty]] (about A.D. 10th century). China is home to some of the oldest artwork in the world. Statues and pottery, as well as decorations made of [[jade]], are some classic examples.

Its land area has mostly looked like that of modern China, except with northern and western edges that varied.  It was often attacked by northern people, such as [[Genghis Khan]] and [[Kublai Khan]].  While China achieved many things in the [[First millennium]] and early [[2nd millennium]], it became an [[isolationism|isolationist]] country in the [[15th century|15th century C.E.]]  

By the [[Renaissance]], European powers started to take over other countries in Asia.  While China was never actually taken over, many [[Europe]]an [[countries]], such as [[Britain]] and [[France]] built [[spheres of influence]] in China.  Since China had cut itself off from the world over the previous few [[centuries]], by the [[Qing Dynasty]], it had fallen behind other countries in [[technology]], and was helpless to stop this from happening.  This had become clear when it lost the [[Opium Wars]] to [[Britain]] in the [[19th century]].  

In 1911, the Republic of China was founded by [[Sun Yat-sen]], but its government was very weak. [[Warlord]]s controlled many areas. [[Chiang Kai-shek]] led wars against them, and became President and dictator.

In 1931, Japan invaded [[Manchuria]], a place in the northeastern part of China. On July 7, 1937, the Japanese attacked the rest of the country, starting what was called the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. The war later became part of [[World War II]]. The war was fought for eight years and millions of Chinese people were killed. In 1945, after the United States dropped atomic bombs on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], Japan surrendered.

However, the [[Chinese Civil War]] later started between the [[Kuomintang]] (Nationalists) of the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) and the Communists of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The Communists wanted to make China like the Soviet Union, whereas the other side wanted to keep China in its current state at the time. The Chinese Civil War was going on throughout World War II. The Communists were led by [[Mao Zedong]], Liu Shaoqi and others. Later Liu lost influence with Mao and his death to this day remains unresolved. The Communists eventually won the war. The Nationalists (led by Chiang Kai-shek) fled to the island of Taiwan and set up their new capital city in Taipei. After the Chinese Civil War, the Communist leader Mao Zedong declared a new country, the People's Republic of China (PRC), in Beijing on October 1, 1949.

Under Mao the country stayed poor while Taiwan became richer. His attempt at [[industrialization]] with the [[Great Leap Forward]] led to the deaths of many people from [[famine]]. The [[Cultural Revolution]] caused great social upheaval. Following his death in 1976, China underwent open market reforms under [[Deng Xiaoping]], and experienced rapid economic growth. China is now one of the largest economies in the world, relying mainly on exports.

In recent history, China has had problems with protests, blocking of information on the [[Internet]], and [[censorship]] in the news. 1989 was notable for the government killing thousands of protesters with tanks in Beijing.

== Culture ==
China is the origin of Eastern [[martial art]]s, called [[Kung-fu|Kung Fu]] or its first name [[Wushu]]. China is also the home of the well-respected [[Spa Monastery]] and [[Wudang Mountains]]. Martial art started more for the purpose of [[survival]] and [[war]]fare than [[art]]. Over time some [[art form]]s have branched off, while others have retained their distinct Chinese flavor. 

China has had renowned [[artist]]s including [[Wong Fei Hung]] ([[Huang Fei Hung]] or [[Hwang Fei Hung]]) and many others. [[Art]] has also co-existed with a variety of [[paint]]s including the more standard 18 colors. Legendary and controversial moves like [[Big Mak]] are also praised and talked about within the [[culture]].

China has many traditional [[festival]]s, such as Spring Festival, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-autumn Festival and so on. The most significant is [[Chinese New Year]]. People in China will have holidays to celebrate these festivals.

=== Festivals ===
Spring Festival is the Chinese New Year. It lasts fifteen days. It starts with the first day of the Chinese lunar year and ends with the full moon fifteen days later. On the first day of the Spring Festival, people call on friends and relatives. Because most of people watch the Spring Festival Celebrations on CCTV all the night on New Year's Eve and don't go to bed until 12:00 AM, they usually get up later in the next day. The fifth day of the Spring Festival is the day to welcome the god of Wealth (Chinese:财神爷), many people make and eat dumplings (Chinese:饺子). They believe that dumplings can hold the god of Wealth and bring luck.The last day of the Spring Festival is the Lantern Festival. On this day, the moon becomes the full moon. People go out and watch the lantern festivals everywhere. After that, they eat sweet dumpling (Chinese:汤圆,元宵), a kind of dumpling which is round and looks like the full moon.

Dragon Boat Festival is celebrated to commemorate the death of Qu Yuan, a patriotic poet of the State of Chu during the [[Warring States]] period. He persuaded his emperor not to accept Qin's diplomats' offers several times but his emperor did not listen to him. He was very sad and ended up jumping into the river to end his life. The people loved him so much that they did not want the fish to eat his corpse. They made and threw rice dumplings into the river. They hope the fish eat these dumplings instead of the poet's corpse. They also rowed dragon boats in the river to get rid of the fish. Such practices, eating rice dumplings and holding dragon boat races, become what Chinese do in this festival nowadays.

Held on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, Mid-Autumn Festival is a festival for families. Now when the festival sets in, people would sit together to eat moon cakes, appreciate the bright full moon cakes, appreciate the bright full moon, celebrate the bumper harvest and enjoy the family love and happiness. To the Chinese people, the full moon symbolizes family reunion, as does the &quot;moon cakes.&quot; Hence the Mid-Autumn Festival is also called the Family Reunion Festival.

In [[geography]] and [[politics]], a '''country''' is a [[political division]]. It is often a [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] [[territory]]. The term is most commonly used for both [[state]] and [[nation]], and also with [[government]]. For example, [[Liechtenstein]] is a country. The [[United Nations]] recognises lots of countries.

'''Colchester''' is a [[town]] in the northern part of the [[England|English]] [[Counties of England|county]] of [[Essex]]. It has a [[population]] of 104,000 people. People believe that Colchester is the oldest [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] town in England.

== History ==
Before Roman times, Colchester was ''Camulodunon''. This is a [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] name that came from [[Camulos]]. Camulos was the [[Celt]]ic [[deity|god]] of [[war]].

The church at the [[Benedictine]] [[abbey]] of [[John the Baptist|Saint John the Baptist]] was destroyed in [[1539]]. This was when King [[Henry VIII]] took the property of the Roman Catholic institutions in England. The only part left is a gate that people still go to visit.

King [[Cunobelinus]] (or &quot;Cunobelin&quot;) was from Colchester.

== Twin cities ==
Colchester is [[sister city|twinned]] with the following cities:
* {{flagicon|Italy}} [[Imola]], [[Italy]]
* {{flagicon|Germany}} [[Wetzlar]], [[Germany]]

'''Important note:''' The Wikimedia Foundation does not own copyright on Wikipedia article texts and illustrations. '''It is therefore useless to email our contact addresses asking for permission to reproduce articles or images''', even if the rules of operation of your company or school mandate that you ask web site operators before copying their content.

The only contents about the use of which you should contact the Wikimedia Foundation are the trademarked Wikipedia/Wikimedia logos.

Permission to reproduce content under the license and technical conditions applicable to Wikipedia (see below and [[:en:Wikipedia:Mirrors and forks]]) has already been granted to everyone without request by the authors of individual articles and images, at least unless they violated Wikipedia rules by uploading copyrighted material without authorization or under incorrect licensing terms. For permission to use it outside these terms, one must contact all the volunteer authors of the text or illustration in question.
&lt;/div&gt;

When someone makes a creation (like a [[book]], [[movie]], [[picture]], [[song]] or [[website]]), they can say how this creation should be used. This is called [[copyright]], and there are [[law]]s that protect it. For someone else to use the creation, they need to get [[wikt:permission|permission]] from the creator or pay a [[fee]].

Laws about copyright were created so that people who write books or songs or make web pages or movies could get [[money]] for their work. 

Someone writes a book and want to sell it. People who want to read the book have to pay the author to get copies of it. He would not want someone else to sell a stolen version of the book, and get money for the work he had done. The author also wants people to know that he was the first person who could write a book like that one; if the book is good, it means the author is good at writing; people who know the author is good at writing may hire the author to write things for them.

The rule of all the Wikipedias, including this one, is that nothing in the Wikipedia can be copyrighted by someone else. The exception is if Wikipedia editors (including named and unnamed editors) have permission to use it. This means that we are ''only'' allowed to copy things from books or from other web pages into the Wikipedia if the writer has said that anyone can copy these things and make changes to them.

The text contained in Wikipedia is copyrighted (automatically, under the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]]) by Wikipedia contributors and licensed to the public under the '''[[GNU Free Documentation License]]''' (GFDL).

==Fair use==
There is an [[wikt:exception|exception]] to the rules of copyright, which is called [[fair use]]. This says that we can copy a ''short'' amount of something (for example, one or two sentences, or a small picture) without permission. Fair use is part of the laws of [[United States of America]] and some other countries. This should only be done if you are going to write about the part that was copied. 

Because people could get very angry at the Wikipedia if we copy the wrong things, it is better not to copy anything onto the Wikipedia unless we are sure it is allowed.

==Moving things from other Wikipedias==
We can move things from other Wikipedias to here. Text from other Wikipedias is copyright and we can only use it if we follow the rules of the [[GFDL]]. According to the GFDL, you must provide attribution (that means, you must say where you got it from) when using someone else's work.

This means that copying between pages (or projects) is OK. When the changes you make are more than just making the words correct, copyright is not kept; this makes you a ''co-author''. You must show respect to the people who wrote what you are copying by saying they did this work. You can do this by writing in your [[Wikipedia:Edit summary|edit summary]] where you have copied the work from. You can also add a note in the article or on the Talk page.

A full step-by-step set of instructions is located at [[Wikipedia:How to copy from another Wikipedia|How to copy from another Wikipedia]]
&lt;!--Thanks to Alex756 for his advice on this.--&gt;

==Copyright does not apply in some cases==
Copyright does not apply is some cases. These are the ones that are probably relevant here:
*There needs to be enough creativity (called ''threshold of originality''). This means that when something is done in a way that is not creative, it cannot be copyrighted. An example would be an alphabetical listing of people's phone numbers.&lt;sup&gt;[[:en:Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service|[REF]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
*There is a time limit on copyright.  If something was created a long time ago, the copyright of it may have [[wikt:expired|expired]].
*Things that are commonly known can usually not be copyrighted. 
*In the context of texts: Very short texts (only a few words long) cannot be copyrighted; please note that this does not apply to [[music]]: [[jingle]]s are very short pieces of music. They allow someone to identify a certain company or product, they can be copyrighted.

'''Cartography''' is making [[map]]s. Cartography is part of [[geography]].
How people make maps is always changing. In the past, maps were drawn by hand, but today most printed maps are made using [[computer]]s. Someone who makes maps is called a cartographer.

Making a map can be as simple as drawing a direction on a napkin, or as complicated as showing a [[census]] of a whole country. Anyone can make a map, but there are people who spend their lives learning how to make complicated maps.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''Creator''' is a person who [[create]]s something.

In some [[religion]]s ([[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]]) [[God]] (or [[Allah]] meaning '''the God''' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) is the most important and original '''Creator''' of the whole [[Universe]] - including [[Man]] who is made &quot;in his image&quot; (see [[Genesis]]) to [[Astronomy|observe]] it and [[control]] it like God. The idea that anything that a person is [[creating]], like an [[idea]], can be [[ownership|owned]] as [[property]] comes from the [[ethical tradition]]s and [[legal code]]s that came from these religions.

In other traditions ([[Buddhism]], [[Native American mythology]]) anyone has this potential for creating, and can become part of the greater creating of the [[universe]]. {{fact|date=January 2013}}[[Stewardship]] of home, [[Ecological footprint|land and all of Earth]] is a test for participating in this, or just good sense.

A [[creative network]], [[social network]] and [[power network]] are also contact networks.  These include some kind of guarantee or expectation of help.  Thus they involve more investment per person.

'''Chorizo''' is a [[pork]] (pig-meat) [[sausage]] which people first made in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. It is made with large pieces of fatty pork, [[chili pepper]] and [[paprika]]. The special taste of this sausage comes from the mild Spanish paprika in it. 

In the western hemisphere, the [[Mexico|Mexican]] and [[Caribbean]] types are better known. These types of chorizo are made with smaller pieces of pork and different seasonings and peppers are used.

Cured smoked chorizo can be [[Eating|eaten]] without [[cooking]]. Fresh chorizo must be cooked before eating. It can be eaten by its self, or as part of [[meal]]. It can also be used in place of ground [[beef]] or pork.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Creativity''' is the [[ability]] of a person or group to make something new and useful or valuable, or the [[process]] of making something new and useful or valuable. It happens in all areas of life - science, art, literature and music. As a personal ability it is very difficult to [[measure]]. The reason is that we don't understand the mental processes that help some people be more creative than others. Judging what is creative is also controversial. Some people say only things which are historically new are creative, while other people say that if it is new for the creator and the people around them, then it is also creativity.

Some think creativity is an important thing that makes [[human]]s different from [[ape]]s. Others recognize that even apes, other [[primates]], other [[mammal]]s and some birds [[adapt]] to [[survive]] by being creative (for example - primates using tools). [[Liane Gabora]] believes that all [[culture]] comes from creativity, not [[imitation]]. Therefore, these people say, [[human science]] should focus on it (pay special attention to it): [[Ethics]] for example would focus on finding creative [[solution]]s to [[ethical dilemma]]s. [[Politics]] would focus on the [[political virtues]] that need some creativity. Imitation would not be the focus of [[education]]. [[Linguistics]] might be more interested in how new words are created by culture, rather than in how existing ones are used in [[grammar]].

[[Intellectual interests]] (recognized as [[intellectual rights]] or [[intellectual property]] in the [[law]]) are a way to [[reward]] creativity in law, but they do not always work very well. A good example is [[copyright]] which is supposed to pay [[author]]s and [[artist]]s, but may only pay [[lawyer]]s to make (imitative) arguments in [[court]].

Creativity is a central question in [[economics]], where it is known as '''ingenuity''' (the ability to come up with new ideas) or '''individual capital''' - [[capacity|capacities]] that [[individual]]s have, that do not arise from simple imitation of what is known already. This is separate from the [[instructional capital]] that might try to [[capture]] some of that in a [[patent]] or [[training]] system that helps others do what the individual leader or [[wikt:founder|founder]] of the system can do. In [[urban economics]] there are various ways to measure creativity - the [[Bohemian Index]] and [[Gay Index]] are two attempts to do this [[wikt:accurate|accurately]] and [[predict]] the [[economic growth]] of [[city|cities]] based on creativity.

[[File:Cathars expelled.JPG|thumb|right|The cathars are expelled from [[Carcassonne]], in the year 1209]]
[[File:Château de Peyrepertuse - Enceinte basse et éperon (est).jpg|thumb|right|The lower, older part of Castle [[Peyrepertuse]]. This castle was one of the last Cathar strongholds to fall]]

The '''Cathar''' [[wikt:faith|faith]] was a version of [[Christianity]]. They were usually considered [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]]. The word 'Cathar' comes the Greek word ''katharos'' meaning 'unpolluted' (from Tobias Churton, ''The Gnostics'') or  &quot;the pure ones&quot;.

== Principles ==
The Cathars believed that the world had been made by a bad god.  They believed that this bad god had taken them from the good god and put them in the world, but inside their bodies there was a spirit, and that spirit needed to return to the good god.  They were famous for a belief in a form of [[reincarnation]] and believed that when someone died the bad god would put that person's spirit in a new body. They believed this cycle of coming back to life could be escaped by a ritual cleansing.  They were opposed to the doctrine of [[sin]].  

[[Women]] were prominent in the faith.  They were [[pacifist]]s.  They didn't eat anything that was made from other animals, including meat and [[milk|cows milk]]. The only [[wikt:exception|exception]] to this was [[fish]]. Fish was OK to eat because they believed fishes were not alive but just things that were sometimes produced from dirt and water.

They preached tolerance of other faiths.  They rejected the usual Christian rules of [[marriage]] and only believed in the New Testament.  An earlier 10th century Bulgarian heresy, [[Bogomilism]] and also [[Manichaeism]] started some of these trends.  

=== Language ===
They used a bible in the language people spoke. Many other Christians used a Bible in [[Latin language|Latin]]. Latin was spoken only by the [[priest]]s.

== Problems ==
In 1145, open challenge to Catholic dominance began.  In about 1165, the first Cathars said that the Church was &quot;full of ravening (starving) wolves and hypocrites&quot; and &quot;worshipping the wrong God&quot;, right in front of the most powerful Catholics. In 1166, the [[Council of Oxford]] in [[England]] wiped out the English Cathars.  It was also suppressed in Northern France.  In 1167, Cathar [[bishop]]s met to discuss organizing a counter Church - in the South of France, the Languedoc nobles protected it, and many noble women became &quot;Perfects&quot;.  Parish clergy had low [[morale]], or confidence.

=== Reactions ===
The [[Catholic Church]] was against Catharism, seeing it as a heresy.

In the South of France there was tremendous [[religious fervor]], and an [[economy]] that was starting to grow, and a social class of  [[merchant]]s and  [[peasant]]s was starting to grow.  Peasants owned their own [[land]].  Meanwhile, in other parts of [[Europe]], peasants were forced to give up their land to [[noble]]s and become [[serf]]s or [[slave]]s - the system of [[feudalism]].  There was a strong central [[absolute monarchy]] that did not exist in the South of France.  The [[burgher]]s and [[banker]]s had more power in this looser system.  [[R. I. Moore]] is a historian who believes that it was desire to crush this system and take over the land that drove the attack.

However, there was real cultural and religious difference to cause problems:  [[Troubador]]s, who combined some of the traditions of the [[Bard]]s of the [[Celt]]s, and [[Jew]]s, were both part of the multicultural society in the South of [[France]].  Their influences were not appreciated by local or Roman Church figures.  The 12th century Roman Catholic [[Monk]]s were founding their [[monastery|monasteries]] outside the towns, drawing the best people there.

=== Results ===
The Cathars thus had little competition.  The Cathar &quot;Perfects&quot;, the so-called Good Men or Good Women, lived restrained lives and spread their faith in towns - where the Catholics in general did not have their best agents.  Also, Cathars preached that only these Good leaders had to follow the regimens their whole lives - lay people could repent only on their deathbeds.  Many 20th century [[Christian sect]]s have similar beliefs.

== The Albigensian Crusade ==
=== Methods ===
The Pope ordered a crusade against the Cathars in southern France.  He said any crusader who answered the call would be given the same rewards as a crusader who went to the Holy Land.  This was an [[absolution]] of all sin.

In the [[Launguedoc]], on the 22nd of July 1209, a force of about 30,000 [[Crusader]]s arrived at the walls of Beziers bearing the cross pattee to mislead and create ease among the Cathars, thinking they were friend, not foe, and  demanded that about 200 Cathars be surrendered.  The people of the town who were mostly Catholic, said that rather than turn over their friends and family, &quot;we would rather be [[flaying|flayed alive]].&quot;  

A mistake by the defenders of [[Beziers]] let thousands of attackers in. Arnauld Amaury made the famous quote &quot;Kill them all, god knows his own&quot;  on being asked how to tell who were Cathars during the assault. Everyone in the town was killed, some while taking refuge in the church.  It is guessed that 20,000 were killed, many of whom were Catholics and not Cathars at all.  The crusade became known as the '''[[Albigensian crusade]]''' after the town of [[Albi]].  It was to wipe out the Cathars almost entirely over forty or so years.  The Crusaders wanted to go home, but were ordered by the Pope to continue until the whole South of France was controlled and all Cathars were dead. In 1210, they attacked the fortress at [[Minerv]] and built &quot;the first great bonfire of heretics&quot; - beginning the practice of [[Pyre|burning at the stake]] that would continue in the [[Inquisition]] of the [[Counter-Reformation]]. It is interesting to note that at the siege of Montsegur when the fires were lit the Cathars ran down the hill and threw themselves on, as their beliefs were very strong.

===Result===
Catharism disappeared from the northern Italian cities after the 1260s, pressured by the Inquisition. The last known Cathar perfectus in the Languedoc, [[Guillaume Bélibaste]], was killed in 1321.

'''Cosmology''' is the branch of [[astronomy]] that deals with the origin, structure, evolution and space-time relationships of the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cosmology&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Collins Dictionary of Astronomy|publisher=HarperCollins|date=2012|origyear=2006|edition=Fifth|first1=John|last1=Daintith|first2=William|last2=Gould|isbn=9780007918485|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA defines cosmology as &quot;The study of the structure and changes in the present universe&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA&quot;&gt;[http://genesismission.jpl.nasa.gov/educate/scimodule/Cosmogony/CosmogonyPDF/CosCosmolTT.pdf NASA education]&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition of cosmology is &quot;the study of the universe, and humanity's place in it&quot;.&lt;ref name=bs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/|title=Christianity: beliefs about creation and evolution|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern cosmology is dominated by the [[Big Bang]] theory, which brings together observational astronomy and [[particle physics]].&lt;ref&gt;http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cosmology&lt;/ref&gt; 

Though the word ''cosmology'' is recent (first used in 1730 in [[Christian Wolff]]'s ''Cosmologia Generalis''), the study of the universe has a long history.

==History==
Until recently, people thought that the [[universe]] was the [[Milky Way]]. They thought this because they could only see the planets up to [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]] and [[star]]s. With the invention of the [[telescope]], our universe got bigger. Even in the 20th century, people thought that the Milky Way was the universe. With the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], people could see things far away.

[[File:Brazil.Brasilia.01.jpg|thumb|[[Brasilia]] Cathedral]]
A '''church''' is a [[building]] that was constructed to allow people to meet to [[worship]] together. These people are usually [[Christianity|Christians]], or influenced by Christianity. Some other religious groups also call their religious buildings churches.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America: 2006 - Page 252&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An Introduction to the Unitarian and Universalist Traditions - Page 128, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the number of people that are in a community, the churches come in different sizes. Small churches are called [[chapel]]s. The churches in a particular geographical area form a group called the [[diocese]].  Each diocese has a [[cathedral]].  In most cases, the cathedral is a very big church. Cathedrals are the seat of [[bishop]]s.

In the [[Early Christianity|early days of Christianity]] people had to worship in secret. Christian worship was not allowed in the [[Roman empire]], so Christians had to meet in a secret place. Sometimes they met in people’s houses or barns, sometimes they met underground. The first places that were built for Christian worship were small chapels that were cut into a rock where people could worship without being discovered.

After the death of the Roman emperor [[Constantine I (Rome)|Constantine]] in [[337]] A.D. Christians were allowed to have buildings to worship in. These first churches were built on a similar plan to Roman [[basilica]]s. This plan was later used for the fine [[Gothic]] cathedrals and churches that were built at the end of the [[Middle Ages]].

== The parts of a church ==
{{further|List of church architecture terms}}

There are several parts in the architecture of a church. Not all churches will have all these parts:

* The '''[[nave]]''' is the main part of the church where the congregation (the people who come to worship) sit. 
* The '''aisles''' (rhymes with “piles”) are the sides of the church which may run along the side of the nave.
* The '''transept''', if there is one, is an area which crosses the nave near the top of the church. This makes the church shaped like a cross, which is a symbol of the belief that [[Jesus]] died on the [[crucifix|cross]].
* The '''chancel''' leads up to the [[altar]] at the top of the church. The altar is in the '''sanctuary'''. The word “[[sanctuary]]” means “sacred place”. People were not allowed to be [[arrest]]ed in the sanctuary, so they were safe. The altar is usually at the [[east]] end of the church. People in the church sit facing the altar. We say that the church “faces east”.
* Churches will also have a '''tower''' or [[steeple]], usually at the west end. If the church has a transept the tower may be above the centre of the transept.

In Roman Catholic churches there is always a stoup (bowl) of [[holy water]] near the entrance of the church. This tradition comes from the fact that Roman [[basilica]]s had a fountain for washing in front of the entrance. The [[font]] is a bowl where people (often babies) are [[baptism|baptized]]. This is also near the entrance of the church. This is a symbol of the fact that it is welcoming the people into the Christian church.

Traditionally the nave has long [[bench]]es for the congregation to sit on. These are called '''pews'''. Some churches may now have replaced their pews with chairs so that they can be moved about for different occasions. At the front of the nave is the '''pulpit''' where the priest [[preach]]es (these talks are called “[[sermon]]s”). There is also a [[lectern]] (like a large [[music stand]]) from where the lessons (the [[Bible]] readings) are read.

If there are aisles along the side of the nave there will be [[column|pillars]] which hold up the roof. In large churches or cathedrals there may be a row of little arches along the top of these pillars. This is called the '''triforium'''. Over the triforium is the '''clerestory''' which is a row of small windows high up in the church wall.

The chancel is the most holy part of the church, and this is why it is often separated from the nave by a screen which can be made of wood or stone, or occasionally iron. The congregation can see through the screen. On the top of the screen there may be a cross. This is called a rood (pronounce like “rude”) screen. Priests used to climb up a staircase to the top of the rood screen to read the [[epistle]] and the [[gospel]]. Sometimes people sung from there.

Inside the chancel are the benches where the [[Choir (music)|choir]] sit. These are called '''choir stalls'''. They are on both sides. The two sides of the choir sit facing one another. The choir members who sit on the left (north side) are called “cantoris” (the side where the “[[Cantor (church)|cantor]]” sits) and those on the right (south side) are called “decani” (the side where the [[deacon]] sits). In some large churches or cathedrals the seats for the priests tip up. The top of these seats, when they are tipped up, are called '''misericords''' (from the Latin word for “mercy”). This is because the priests or monks were able to lean against them when they got tired if they had to stand up for a long time.

Sometimes there are holes in the walls of the screen so that the congregation can see through. These are called '''squints'''. If there is a recess in the wall it is called an '''aumbry'''. It is a cupboard for [[Eucharist|communion]] [[wine]] that has been blessed by a priest.

The altar may be right at the east end of the church, but in larger churches or cathedrals it is often much farther forward. In that case the very east end is called an '''apse'''. Sometimes it is a separate chapel called the “Lady Chapel”.

== Churches through the ages ==

The design of churches changed a lot during the course of history. Often churches were made bigger. When this happened there may be a mixture of architectural styles. These styles vary a lot in different countries.

=== English churches ===

In [[England|English]] churches there were several different periods of architecture:

* The [[Saxon architecture|Saxon]] period ([[7th century|700]]-[[1050]]) was a time when churches were very simple. The end of the church (end of the sanctuary) was often rounded. Hardly any are left now because they were mostly made of [[wood]].
* The [[Norman architecture|Norman]] period ([[1050]]-[[1190]]) came from the style called [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] which was popular in Europe. The arches had ornaments which were called “mouldings”. The tops of the pillars looked like [[cushion]]s, so they were called “cushion capitals”. The windows were narrow and rounded at the top.
* [[Early English architecture|Early English]] or [[Gothic architecture]] ([[1190]]-[[1280]]) was not as solid and heavy as Norman architecture. Towers were elegant and tall, like the tower of [[Salisbury Cathedral]].
* The [[Decorated architecture|Decorated]] style of architecture ([[1280]]-[[1360]])was popular at a time when the [[plague]] (Black Death) was raging and a third of the people in England died. For that reason, not so much building was done then. There were lots of stone carvings were made in churches at that time.
* The [[Perpendicular architecture|Perpendicular]] style ([[1360]]-[[1540]]) was very grand. It had lots of straight upward lines and [[fan vaulting]]. This can be seen in [[Westminster Abbey]] and [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge]]. Many churches that can be seen in England were built in this period.

In the 1600s, churches were built in a variety of styles. Often they copied some of the older styles. After the [[Great Fire of London]] many new churches were built by the architect Sir [[Christopher Wren]]. They were built in the classical style. Churches continued to be built in later centuries like this, but also the Gothic style continued to be used.

Modern churches often do not have the traditional cross-shape. It is difficult for the congregation to see and hear what is happening in the chancel. Modern churches bring the congregation, choir and priests in closer touch. An example is the round design for the [[Church of Christ the Cornerstone, Milton Keynes|Church of Christ the Cornerstone]] in [[Milton Keynes]]. Modern churches are often simpler but with a warmer character than the Gothic churches. Many have beautiful [[mosaic]] glass windows. [[Coventry Cathedral]] is a famous example of a modern church building.

A '''city''' {{Audio|En-uk-city.ogg|pronunciation}}) is a place where many people [[wikt:live|live]] together. A city has many [[building]]s and [[street]]s. It has houses or apartments for many people to live, shops where they may buy things, places for people to work and a [[government]] [[organisation]] to run the city, and to keep [[law]] and [[wikt:order|order]] in the city. Many people live in cities because it is easy for them to find and do the things they want there. A city usually has a &quot;city centre&quot; where government and [[business]] take place, and places called [[suburb]]s where people live around the outside of the centre.

==Definition==
[[Image:Hobart Marina MTWellington.jpg|thumb|250px|Hobart, a small city in [[Australia]]]]
There is no rule that is used all over the world to decide why some places are called &quot;city&quot; and other places are called &quot;town&quot;. 

Some things that make a city are: 
* A long history.
* A large [[population]]. 
* A centre where business and [[local government]] takes place.
* Special powers called [[town privileges]] which have been given by the government of the [[country]], or its ruler. This was done especially during the [[Middle Ages]]. 
* Having a cathedral or a [[university]]. This rule is found in the United Kingdom. The smallest &quot;cathedral cities&quot; are St. David's and St Asaph's which are both in [[Wales]], and Ripon and Wells which are in England.
 
In American English, people often call all places cities.&lt;ref&gt;In the USA, on forms (papers asking for information), the word &quot;City&quot; is generally used for the place where a person lives, even if the person who wants to write in the form might live in a city, a town, or a [[village]] or hamlet (a very small village).&lt;/ref&gt; (See below: Size of cities)

==Size of cities== 
[[Image:004SFEC LONDON-200705.JPG|thumb|250px|The River Thames is part of London's transport system. This picture shows the &quot;City of London&quot;.]] 
[[image:Skyscrapers of Shinjuku 2009 January.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Tokyo]], is the world's most populous metropolitan area.]]
The sizes of cities can be very different. This depends on the type of city that it is. Cities that were built hundreds of years ago and which have not changed much, are very much smaller than modern cities. There are two main reasons. One reason is that old cities often have a city wall, and most of the city is inside it. Another important reason is that the streets in old cities are often narrow. If the city got too big, it was hard for a cart carrying food to get to the [[market place]]. People in cities need food, and the food always has to come from outside the city. Cities that were on a river like [[London]] could grow much bigger than cities that were on a mountain like [[Sienna]] in [[Italy]], because the river made a [[transport]] route for carrying food and other [[goods]], as well as for transporting people. London has been changing continually for hundreds of years, while Siena, which was a very important city in the 1300s has changed very little in 700 years. Modern cities with modern transport systems can grow very large, because the streets are wide enough for cars, buses and trucks, and there are often railway lines as well.

In the US, the word city is often used for towns that are not very big. When the first European people went to America, they gave the name &quot;city&quot; to new places. They hoped the places would be great cities in the future. For example, Salt Lake City was the name given to a village of 148 people. When they started building the town they made street plans and called it Great Salt Lake City (for the nearby Great Salt Lake). Now, 150 years later, it really is a big city. 

In modern times many cities have grown bigger and bigger. The whole area is often called a ''&quot;[[metropolis]]&quot;'' and can sometimes includes several small ancient towns and villages. The ''metropolis'' of London includes the City of London, the City of Westminster and many old villages such as Notting Hill, Southwark, Richmond, Greenwich and etc. The part that is officially known as the &quot;City of London&quot; only takes up one square mile. The rest is known as &quot;Greater London&quot;. Many other cities have grown in the same way. 

These giant cities can be exciting places to live, and many people can find good jobs there, but modern cities also have many problems. Many people cannot find jobs in the cities and have to get [[money]] by [[beggar|begging]] or by [[crime]]. [[Car]]s, factories, and [[garbage|waste]] create a lot of [[pollution]] that makes people sick.

==Urban history== 
[[Image:Carcassonne-vignes.jpg|thumb|250px|Carcassonne is an ancient city in [[France]].]] 

[[Urban]] History is history of [[civilization]]. The first cities were made in ancient times, as soon as people began to create [[civilization]]. Famous ancient cities which fell to [[ruins]] included [[Babylon]], [[Troy]], [[Mycenae]] and Mohenjo Daro.

[[Benares]] in northern [[India]] is one among the ancient cities which has a history of more 3000 years. Other cities that have existed since ancient times are [[Athens]] in [[Greece]], [[Rome]] and [[Volterra]] in [[Italy]], [[Alexandria]] in [[Egypt]] and [[York]] in England.

In [[Europe]], in the [[Middle Ages]], being a city was a special [[wikt:privilege|privilege]], granted by [[nobility]]. Cities that fall into this category, usually had (or still have) city walls. The people who lived in the city were privileged over those who did not. Medieval cities that still have walls include [[Carcassonne]] in [[France]], [[Tehran]] in [[Iran]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in [[Spain]] and [[Canterbury]] in [[England]]. 

In the [[United Kingdom]], a city is a town which people have always called a city, or which has got the name &quot;city&quot; status by royal charter (a special paper from the king or queen). Cities usually get this because they have a special number of people or are important. In the past, cities got that name if they had a cathedral or a university. Some cathedral cities, for example St David's, are small, and people do not normally think of them as cities. Cities that became cities because of their university generally grow because more people move there to be educated at the university colleges. The university cities of [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]] are famous throughout the world. 

==World's largest cities==
[[Image:Rocinha Favela.jpg|thumb|250px|In [[Rio de Janeiro]], a city famous for its beauty, large slums lie between the richest districts. Many of the world's large cities have areas of [[poverty]] like this.]] 
[[File:KL-Skyline Night HDR.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Kuala Lumpur]],[[Malaysia]], shows a modern city centre lit up at night.]]
These cities have more than 10 million people:

*[[Shanghai]], [[China]] - 23 million
*[[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] - 20+ million
*[[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]] - 18 million
*[[Mumbai]], [[India]] - 18 million

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Bakken.jpg|thumb|Cooking food on a stove.]]
'''Cooking''' is a process to make [[food]] ready to eat by [[heat]]ing it. People can cook food with [[fire]] using [[wood]] or [[charcoal]], with a [[stove]] that uses [[propane]] or [[natural gas]], or with a stove that uses [[electricity]]. An [[oven]] is a part of a stove that is like a [[box]]. People also build ovens out of [[clay]] or [[brick]]s.

There are several different ways to cook food. We [[Boiling|boil]] food by cooking it in water. We [[Frying|fry]] food by cooking it in hot [[butter]], [[fat]] or [[oil]]. We [[Baking|bake]] food by keeping it hot in an [[oven]]. 
We [[roast]] or grill food by holding it over a hot fire.

People often cook [[meat]] by boiling, roasting or grilling it. People bake [[bread]]. Some breads are [[Frying|fried]].

Usually we cook the food in some kind of [[pot]] or [[pan]].  Sometimes people cook food by putting it directly into the fire, by wrapping the food in [[leaves]] before they put it into the fire, or holding it over a fire with a [[stick]].

Before foods are cooked, we say they are [[raw]]. Some foods are good to eat raw.  Other foods are not good for the body when they are raw, so they must be cooked. Some foods are good to eat either raw or cooked and can be used in different recipes.

[[Image:Cooks 050918 154402.jpg|thumb|Cooks at work.]]
A person whose job it is to cook food may be called a '''cook''' or a '''chef'''.  However, the word '''cooker''' means a [[machine]] or [[tool]] that a cook might use to cook food, such as a ''[[rice]] cooker.''

To many people, cooking is an art. To many other people, it is a job.
Cooking as an [[art]] is [[preparing]] the food so it tastes and looks really good.

==Economy==

There is a large [[economy]] for cooking in the world. [[Restaurant]]s [[hire]] skilled cooks for amounts of [[money]] and [[customer]]s pay for [[meal]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To '''chat''' is to '''talk''' about ordinary things that are not very important. A person can chat with another person, or to many people.

A '''crime''' (or '''misdemeanor''' or '''felony''') is an act, that a [[person]] does, which is against the [[law]]s of a [[country]] or region. A person who does this is called a '''criminal'''.

The basic idea of what things are called &quot;crimes&quot; is that they are thought to be things that might cause a problem for another person. Things like [[kill]]ing another person, [[injury|injuring]] another person, or [[steal]]ing from another person are crimes in most countries. Also, it can be a crime to eat some types of food, such as meat of rare exotic animals, [[marijuana]] leaves, or [[mushroom]]s that contain [[psychedelic]] drugs.

When some criminals make money from crime, they try to stop the [[police]] finding out where the money came from by [[money laundering]].

== Levels of crime ==
There are various levels of crimes:
* '''misdemeanor''' - is a minor crime, typically punished by a fee or less than 1 year in [[jail]].
* '''felony''' (or '''high crime''') - is a major crime, typically punished by 1 year or longer in [[prison]].

Different countries have many different ideas of what things are crimes, and which are severe enough to be treated as felonies. Some things that are crimes in one country are not crimes in other countries. Many countries get their ideas of what things are crimes from [[religion]]s or controversial events which cause a law to be quickly created. For example, a religion might consider eating a particular food to be a crime. Another example, is the ban, in some regions, on [[texting]]-while-driving an [[automobile]] (or train), as new laws created after people died from wrecks when they were distracted by [[mobile phone]] messages.

In many countries, if people say they made or wrote a [[book]], [[movie]], [[song]], or [[Web page]] that they did not really write or make, it is a crime against the laws of [[copyright]]. In many countries, helping to grow, make, move, or sell [[illegal drug]]s is a crime. 

In most countries, [[police]] try to stop crimes and to find criminals. When the police find someone who they think might be a criminal, they usually hold the person in a [[jail]]. Then, usually, a [[court]] or a [[judge]] decides if the person really did a crime. If the court or judge decides that the person really did it, then he or she might have to pay a [[fine]] or go to [[prison]]. Sometimes the judge might decide that the criminal should be [[execute]]d (killed). This is called [[Capital punishment]] (or the ''Death Penalty''). There are countries in the world who execute criminals, and others who do not.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Time Cube''' is a [[website]] created by [[Gene Ray]]. On that website, Dr. Ray explains his &quot;Time Cube&quot; theory, which describes the planet [[Earth]] as having a [[cube|cubic]] [[symmetry]], and [[time]] as rotating four &quot;corners&quot;. He also says that all of modern [[physics]] is wrong. Many scientists reject these ideas, saying that they make no sense and cannot be [[test]]ed.

The Time Cube website is written in an angry and hateful voice. On his site, Ray says that anyone who does not believe in Time Cube is &quot;stupid and evil&quot;. Some of the comments are [[racism|racist]], especially against black people and [[Judaism|Jews]]. There are also many comments against [[homosexuality|gay]] people. Many people find the site to be difficult to understand. 

Ray has spoken about Time Cube at two universities in the [[United States]], MIT and Georgia Tech. At MIT, a professor tried to cancel the lecture before it took place. Ray believes this is proof of a [[conspiracy]] to keep information about Time Cube hidden.

Its head is [[Ron O'Dor]] of [[Dalhousie University]] in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], Canada. It uses data from researchers all over the world. More than 70 [[nation]]s are involved and over a [[billion]] [[United States dollar|US dollars]] will be spent on it. 

It is a major work of [[marine ecology]].

It is trying to do what the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) and [[National Geographic Society]] did for [[terrestrial ecoregion]]s - say exactly what is alive on the planet.

In this case, in the seas.

'''Maize''' (called '''corn''' in some countries) is a member of the [[grass]] [[family (biology)|family]] ''Poaceae''.  It is a cereal [[grain]] that was first grown by people in ancient [[Central America]].  It is now the third most important cereal crop in the world.  It is a leafy stalk whose kernels contain seeds inside. It is an [[angiosperm]], which means that its seeds are enclosed inside a fruit or shell. It is used as a [[food]] staple by many people in [[Mexico]], Central and [[South America]] and parts of [[Africa]].  In [[Europe]] and the rest of [[North America]], maize is grown mostly for use as [[animal]] feed. In [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], maize is commonly referred to as &quot;corn&quot;. In recent years corn has become an important part in a majority of American foods due to the use of [[corn starch]]. 

Maize has been a fruitful [[model organism]] for [[genetic]] research over many years: see [[Barbara McClintock]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{unsourced|date=September 2009}}
'''Calculus''' is a branch of [[mathematics]] which helps us understand changes between values that are related by a [[Function (mathematics)|function]]. For example, if you had one formula telling how much money you got every day, calculus would help you understand related formulas like how much money you have in total, and whether you are getting more money or less than you used to.   All these formulas are  [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of time, and so that is one way to think of calculus -- studying functions of time. There are two different types of calculus. '''Differential calculus''' divides things into small (''different'') pieces and tells us how they change from one moment to the next, while '''integral calculus''' joins (''integrates'') the small pieces together and tells us how much of something is made, overall, by a series of changes. Calculus is used in many different areas of study such as [[physics]], [[astronomy]], [[biology]], [[engineering]], [[economics]], [[medicine]] and [[sociology]].

The word '''Calculus''' comes from the [[Latin language]] meaning &quot;small stone&quot;.

==History==
In the 1670s and 1680s, Sir [[Isaac Newton]] in England and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] in Germany figured out calculus at the same time, working separately from each other. Newton wanted to have a new way to predict where to see [[planet]]s in the sky, because [[astronomy]] had always been a popular and useful form of science, and knowing more about the motions of the objects in the night sky was important for [[navigation]] of ships. Leibniz wanted to measure the space (area) under a [[curve]] (a line which is not straight). Many years later, the two men argued over who discovered it first. Scientists from England supported Newton, but scientists from the rest of Europe supported Leibniz. Most [[mathematician]]s today agree that both men share the credit equally. Some parts of modern calculus come from Newton, such as its uses in [[physics]]. Other parts come from Leibniz, such as the symbols used to write it.

They were not the first people to use mathematics to describe the physical world—[[Aristotle]] and [[Pythagoras]] came earlier, and so did [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], who said that mathematics was the language of science. But they were the first to design a system that describes how things change over time and can predict how they will change in the future.

The name &quot;calculus&quot; was the [[Latin language|Latin]] word for a small stone the ancient [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s used in counting and [[gambling]]. The English word &quot;calculate&quot; comes from the same Latin word.

==Differential calculus==
{{main|Differential calculus}}   

'''Differential calculus''' is the process of finding out the rate of change of a [[variable]] compared to another variable. It can be used to find the speed of a moving object or the slope of a curve, figure out the maximum or minimum points of a curve, or find answers to problems in the [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]] areas of physics, among many other uses.

Many amounts can be variables, which can change their value unlike numbers such as 5 or 200. Some examples of variables are [[distance]] and [[time]]. The [[speed]] of an object is how far it travels in a particular time. So if a town is 80 kilometres (50 miles) away and a person in a car gets there in one hour, they have traveled at an average speed of 80 kilometres (50 miles) per hour. But this is only an [[average]]—they may have been traveling faster at some times (on a highway) and slower at others (at a traffic light or on a small street where people live). Imagine a driver trying to figure out a car's speed using only its odometer (distance meter) and clock, without a speedometer!

Until calculus was invented, the only way to work this out was to cut the time into smaller and smaller pieces, so the average speed over the smaller time would get closer and closer to the actual speed at a point in time. This was a very long and hard process and had to be done each time people wanted to work something out.

[[File:Simple curve showing tangents.svg|thumb|right|On a curve, two different points have different slopes. The red and blue lines are [[Trigonometric function|tangent]]s to the curve.]]

A very similar problem is to find the [[wikt:slope|slope]] (how steep it is) at any point on a [[curve]]. The slope of a ''[[straight]]'' line is easy to work out—it is simply how much it goes up (''y'' or [[wikt:vertical|vertical]]) divided by how much it goes across (''x'' or [[wikt:horizontal|horizontal]]). On a ''curve'', though, the slope is a variable (has different values at different points) because the line bends. But if the curve was to be cut into very, very small pieces, the curve at the point would look almost like a very short straight line. So to work out its slope, a straight line can be drawn through the point with the same slope as the curve at that point. If it is done exactly right, the straight line will have the same slope as the curve, and is called a [[Trigonometric function|tangent]]. But there is no way to know (without very complicated mathematics) whether the tangent is exactly right, and our eyes are not accurate enough to be certain whether it is exact or simply very close.

What Newton and Leibniz found was a way to work out the slope (or the speed in the distance example) exactly using simple and logical rules. They divided the curve into an [[infinity|infinite]] number of very small pieces. They then chose points on either side of the range they were interested in and worked out tangents at each. As the points moved closer together towards the point they were interested in, the slope ''approached'' a particular value as the tangents approached the real slope of the curve. They said that this particular value it approached was the actual slope.

[[File:First principles differentiation demo.svg|thumb|220px|A picture that shows what ''x'' and ''x + h'' mean on the curve.]]

Let's say we have a function ''y'' = f(''x''). f is short for [[function (mathematics)|function]], so this equation means &quot;y is a function of x&quot;. This tells us that how high y is on the [[vertical]] axis depends on what x (the [[horizontal]] axis) is at that time. For example with the equation ''y'' = ''x''², we know that if ''x'' is 1, then ''y'' will be 1; if ''x'' is 3, then ''y'' will be 9; if ''x'' is 20, then ''y'' will be 400.

&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\rightarrow0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}&lt;/math&gt;

If we use y = x², the '''derivative''' produced [[Differential calculus#How_it_works|using this method]] is 2''x'', or 2 multiplied by ''x''. So we know without having to draw any tangent lines that at any point on the curve ''f(x)'' = ''x''², the '''derivative''' ''f'(x)'' (marked with an [[apostrophe]]) will be 2''x'' at any point. This process of working out a slope using limits is called '''differentiation''', or finding the derivative.

Leibniz came to the same result, but called h &quot;dx&quot;, which means &quot;a tiny amount of x&quot;. He called the resulting change in f(x) &quot;dy&quot;, which means &quot;a tiny amount of y&quot;. Leibniz's notation is used by more books because it is easy to understand when the equations become more complicated. In Leibniz notation:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(x)&lt;/math&gt;

Mathematicians have grown this basic theory to make simple [[algebra]] rules which can be used to find the derivative of almost any function.

==Main idea of calculus==
The main idea in calculus is called the &quot;Fundamental Theorem of Calculus&quot;. This main idea says that the two calculus processes, differential and integral calculus, are opposites. That is, a person can use differential calculus to undo an integral calculus process. Also, a person can use integral calculus to undo a differential calculus method. This is just like using division to &quot;undo&quot; multiplication, or addition to &quot;undo&quot; subtraction.

In a single sentence, the Fundamental Theorem runs something like this: &quot;The derivative of the integral of a function ''f'' is the function itself&quot;.

==Demonstration of main idea of calculus==
===How to use integral calculus to find areas===
The method integral calculus uses to find areas of shapes is to break the shape up into many small boxes, and add up the area of each of the boxes. This gives an approximation to the area.  If the boxes are made narrower and narrower, then there are more and more of them, and the area of all the boxes becomes very close to the area of the shape.  One of the main ideas of calculus is that we can imagine having an infinite number of these boxes, each infinitely narrow, and then we would have the exact area of the shape.

==Other uses of calculus==
Calculus is used to describe things that [[wikt:change|change]], like things in [[nature]]. It can be used for showing and learning all of these:

*How [[wave (physics)|wave]]s move. Waves are very important in the [[natural]] world. For example, [[sound]] and [[light]] can be thought of as waves.
*Where [[heat]] moves, like in a house. This is useful for [[architecture]] (building houses), so that the house can be as cheap to heat as possible.
*How very small things like [[atoms]] [[act]].
*How fast something will [[falling|fall]], also known as [[gravity]].
*How [[machine|machines]] work, also known as [[mechanics]].
*The [[orbit|path]] of the [[moon]] as it moves around the [[earth]]. Also, the path of the earth as it moves around the [[sun]], and any [[planet]] or [[moon]] moving around anything in [[Outer space|space]].

A '''coin''' is normally a [[round]] piece of [[metal]] that is used as [[currency]], or money. Coins have been made for about 2600 years; the first place to make coins was Lydia (modern [[Turkey]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.stateuniversity.com/pages/13993/Lydia.html|title=Lydia|accessdate=2009-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
Many coins have unique or complicated [[decorations]]; one side often has the picture of a famous or important person's [[head]] on it. Most people use coins as [[currency]]. 

=== Uses ===
The different decorations on each side of a coin might be used to decide things [[random]]ly. This is called &quot;tossing a coin&quot;.  A person can throw the coin into the air and catch it.  You then look at which side is facing up. If the head is facing up it is called &quot;heads&quot;, if the other side is facing up it is called &quot;tails&quot;. Before tossing the coin someone has to decide what each side means. 

==== Gambling ====
Tossing a coin can be a type of [[gambling]], which is [[illegal]] (against the law) in some [[country|countries]]. However, it is fine if something is gambled upon without a price someone risks. If it's merely to decide something, that is alright. Coins can be used to buy many things, and are often used for buying things such as apples, toothbrushes, and many others. Coins aren't as efficient as money bills, but are still used.

== Other views ==
Some people see coins as a sign of greed, such as some [[Communist]]s and [[Puritan]]s, who sometimes condemn over-hoarding of coins, and [[ascetic]]s, who often keep little in the ways of [[money]] (coins), leading a &quot;poor&quot;-lifestyle.

== Collecting ==
{{main|Coin collecting}}
Because coins have been made for a very long time, some people collect old coins. They can be much cheaper than other old things, especially if they are made of cheap metals like [[copper]]. Older coins normally cost more than newer ones, but rarity matters more-some coins from the 1920s cost vast sums, while some Roman coins cost very little.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''conceptual metaphor''' or '''cognitive metaphor''' is a [[metaphor]] which refers to one domain (group of ideas) in terms of another. For example, treating [[quantity]] in terms of [[direction]]:
#''Prices are rising''.
#''I attacked every weak point in his argument''. (Argument as war rather than enquiry or search for truth).
#''Life is a journey''.
#''Love'' talked about as if it were ''war'' or ''competition''.
#''Time'' talked about as if it were a ''path through space'', or a ''quantity'' that can be saved or spent or wasted.

The idea of a conceptual metaphor came from a book by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson in 1980: ''Metaphors we live by''.
:&quot;The most recent linguistic approach to literature is that of cognitive metaphor, which claims that metaphor is not a mode of language, but a mode of thought&quot;. Donald Freeman.

== Political metaphors ==
* '''eminence grise''': literally, &quot;grey man,&quot; from French. Colloquially, the power-behind-the-throne. An official close to the president or monarch who has so much power behind the scenes that he or she may double or serve as the monarch.
* '''figurehead''': a leader whose powers are entirely symbolic, such as a [[constitutional monarch]].
* '''puppet government''': a government that is manipulated by a foreign power for its own interests.
* '''star chamber''': a secretive council or other group within a government that possesses the actual power, regardless of the government's overt form.
* '''character assassination''': spreading (usually) manufactured stories about a candidate with the intent to destroy his or her reputation in the eyes of the public.
* '''landslide victory''': a huge victory for one side.
* '''riding coattails''': victories by local or state politicians because of the popularity of more powerful politicians.
* '''grassroots''': a political movement driven by the constituents of a community.
* '''astroturfing''': formal public relations campaigns in politics and advertising that seek to create the impression of being spontaneous, grassroots behavior.
* '''[[straw man]]''': the practice of refuting an argument that is weaker than one's opponent actually offers, or which he simply has not put forth at all. A type of logical fallacy.
* '''Spin''' (public relations): a heavily biased portrayal of an event or situation.
* '''[[witch-hunt]]''': a hysterical pursuit of political enemies
* '''bread and circuses''': satisfaction of shallow or immediate desires of the populace at the expense of good policy; also, the erosion of civic duty and the public life in a populace.

There are many more, enough to prove the importance of the metaphor in our lives.

'''Comedy''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: Kωμωδία) may be used in different ways:
*A comedy is, in modern times, a [[drama]] which has a generally [[funny]] content and in general a happy ending. This definition is used for [[theatre]] [[Play (theatre)|plays]], and was first used in [[Ancient Greek theatre|Ancient Greece]]. 
*The word comedy is also used for [[television]] shows or [[movie]]s that are funny, silly or that make people [[laughter|laugh]]. 
Comedies may also show people telling jokes and funny stories. People who are known for acting in comedies are [[comedian]]s or comedic actors.

== History ==
=== Satire ===
The ancient Greeks had comedies, which were presented in [[competition]]s at the [[festival]] of [[Dionysus|Dionysia]]. 

One of the best-known comedy authors of the time was [[Aristophanes]] (about 446{{ndash}}386 BC). One of his works, ''[[The Clouds]]'' was performed 425 BC. The work did not survive completely, but a later version did survive. It is a satire against [[Socrates]], and pictures the great philosopher as a swaggering con artist. Some of the accusations were re-used at Socrates' [[trial]], twenty years later.  

Typical for satire are that the author criticizes society, and living people. 

=== Satyr plays ===
Another type of Ancient Greek theatre was the [[satyr play]]. This was mock [[drunkenness]], brazen [[sexuality]] (including [[Phallus|phallic]] props), pranks, sight gags, and general merriment. The modern equivalent would be knock-about comedy.

=== Humour ===
Humour, or 'New Comedy' is not about criticizing people or ideas, but rather about showing characters in funny situations. The most important Greek playwright of this type was probably [[Menander]]. The best known [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] comedy writer was [[Plautus]]. He often used Greek comedies for his plays.

Many comedy plays were written in the 1500s by the British writer [[William Shakespeare]].
Shakespeare's comedy plays include:'' [[All’s Well That Ends Well]], [[The Comedy of Errors]], [[A Midsummer Nights Dream]]'', and ''[[Twelfth Night]]''. In Shakespeare's day a comedy did not mean a play that would make people laugh or that had a lot of jokes. Instead it was a play in which all the problems work out all right in the end. This was unlike a tragedy, where the problems do not work out, usually resulting in someone's death.
The two masks, one was smiling, the other crying, often associated with theatre represent comedy and tragedy.

== Types ==
=== Slapstick ===
There are different types of comedy. One type of comedy is called &quot;slap stick comedy.&quot; In &quot;slap stick comedy,&quot; people do silly things such as tripping, falling over or embarrassing themselves just to make people laugh. Slap stick comedy can be used in comedy movies or comedy television shows.

Slap stick comedy was used a lot in [[silent movies|silent (no sound) movies]] from the 1920s. A comedian who acted in the silent movies who used a lot of slapstick comedy was [[Charlie Chaplin]]. In the 1950s and 1960s, comedian [[Jerry Lewis]] also used silly slap stick comedy in his comedy movies.

=== Comedy movies ===
A comedy is a very popular type of movie. Some comedy movies have &quot;slapstick comedy,&quot; in which people just do silly things such as tripping, falling over or embarrassing themselves just to make people laugh. Other comedy movies show funny stories or situations in which people are behaving in a silly manner. Some comedies make the audience laugh by showing strange or unusual images or situations that do not make sense.


=== Parody/spoof ===
A parody or spoof movie makes another movie, series or person look silly to make people laugh.
Imitating and exaggerating one movie in a funny manner to make people laugh 


==== Different types of comedy movies ====
Some types of comedy movies mix comedy with other types of movies. 
*There is a type of movie called a '''[[dramedy]]''', which is a mix of a drama movie and a comedy movie. 
*There is also a type of movie called a '''[[romantic comedy]]''' (sometimes called a &quot;rom-com&quot;). In romantic comedies, there is a love story about a couple who fall in love, along with silly or funny comedy parts.

=== Comedy television shows ===
Comedy shows are very popular on [[television]]. Comedy shows on television are often called &quot;[[situational comedies|sitcoms]].&quot; The word &quot;sitcom&quot; is a shortened way of saying &quot;situational comedy.&quot; Television situational comedies usually show characters who do silly or funny things which make the audience laugh.

      <comment>/* History of comets */ [[Halley's Comet]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{otheruses|the objects in [[outer space|space]]|store|Comet (shop)}}
[[File:CometDiagram.gif|thumb|205px|Diagram of a comet's [[orbit]]]]
A '''comet''' is a [[ball]] of mostly [[ice]] that moves around in [[outer space]]. They are often described as &quot;dirty snowballs&quot;.  They are very different from [[asteroid]]s. In the [[solar system]], the [[orbit]]s of comets go further than [[Pluto (planet)|Pluto]].  Most are very far away from the Sun, but some come near enough to Earth for us to see at [[wikt:night|night]].  They have long &quot;tails&quot;, because the Sun [[melt]]s the ice. A comet's tail does not trail behind it, but points directly away from the Sun, because it is blown by the [[solar wind]].

The hard [[centre]] of the comet is the ''[[comet nucleus|nucleus]]''. It is one of the blackest things in the solar system. When [[light]] shone on the nucleus of [[Halley's Comet]], the comet reflected only 4% of the light back to us.

[[Periodic comets|''Periodic'' comets]] visit again and again. ''Non-periodic'' or ''single-apparition'' comets visit only once.

Comets sometimes break up, as [[Comet Biela]] did in the 19th century.  [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]] broke up, and the pieces hit [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] in [[1994]]. Some comets orbit (go around) together in groups. [[Astronomer]]s think these comets are broken pieces that used to be one object.

== History of comets ==
In old times, people used to be scared of comets. They did not know what they were, or where they came from. Some thought that they were fireballs sent from demons or gods to destroy the earth. They said that each time a comet appeared, it would bring bad luck with it. Whenever a comet appeared, a king would die. For example, the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] shows the return of [[Halley's Comet]] and the death of a king. Comets were also known to end wars and thought to bring famine.  During the [[Renaissance]], [[astronomer]]s started to look at comets with less superstition and to base their [[science]] on observations. [[Tycho Brahe]] reasoned that comets did not come from the earth, and his calculations showed that comets must be six times farther than the earth is from the moon.

[[Edmond Halley]] reasoned that some comets are periodic, that is, they appear again after a certain number of years, and again and again. This led to the first prediction of a comet's return, [[Halley's Comet]], named after him.

[[Isaac Newton]] also studied comets. He realised that comets make U-turns around the sun. He asked his friend Edmond Halley to publish this in his book ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''. Before Newton said this, people believed that comets go in to the sun, then another comes out from behind the sun. 

In later years some astronomers thought comets were spit out by planets, especially [[Jupiter]].

All this new information and research gave people confidence, but some still thought that comets were messengers from the gods. One 18th century vision said that comets were the places that [[hell]] was, where souls would ride, being burned up by the heat of the sun and frozen by the cold of space.

In modern times [[space probe]]s have visited comets to learn more about them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cytology''' is the study of the [[cell]]s, especially their appearance and [[structure]]. Cells are the small parts that make up all living things, and their effects on each other and their [[environment]].

There are two types of cells. [[Prokaryote|Prokaryotic]] cells do not have a clear and easy-to-see [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], and do not have a [[membrane]], or wall, around them. [[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic]] cells have an easy-to-see nucleus where all of the cell's functions take place, and a membrane around them. The main [[organelle]]s of a cell and their uses are: 
* [[Mitochondria]]: produces [[energy]] for the cell
* [[Endoplasmic reticulum]]: makes [[protein]]s and [[carbohydrate]]s for the cell to use
* [[Golgi body|Golgi bodies]]: store and package products that the cell uses
* Plastid (present in plant cells only): contains chemicals needed to [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]] (create energy from sunlight); in plants only.
* Nucleus: directs the actions of the cell
* [[Centrosome]]s: guides the cell in [[mitosis]] and [[meiosis]], the processes for cell division.

[[File:Famous Christians aroun the world.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Set of pictures for a number of famous Christians from various fields]]
A '''Christian''' {{audio|En-us-Christian.ogg}} is a [[Human|person]] who believes in [[Christianity]], a [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] [[religion]]. Christianity is mostly about the [[life]] and [[teach]]ings of [[Jesus Christ]], in the [[New Testament]]&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/ |title=''BBC - Religion &amp; Ethics - Christianity'' |accessdate=2008-07-11 |format= |work=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Interpretation|interpreted]] of [[Prophecy|prophesied]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]]/[[Old Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=29&amp;chapter=53&amp;version=31 |title=''Book of Isaiah, Chapter 53'' |accessdate=2008-07-11 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christianity is the world's largest religion, with 2.1 billion followers around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt; The Quran states that true Christians should love Muslims; &quot;And thou wilt find the nearest of them in affection to those who believe (to be) those who say: Lo! We are Christians.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an, Sura 5 (Al-Ma'ida), ayat 82-85&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians consider the Holy Bible to be a sacred book, inspired by God.  The Holy Bible is a combination of the Hebrew Bible, or Torah, and a collection of writings called the New Testament.  Views on the importance of these writings vary.  Some Christian groups prefer to favor the New Testament, while others believe the entire Bible is equally important.  Also, while many Christians prefer to consider the Bible as true, inspired by God, not all groups believe that it is completely accurate.  Some of these groups may think that the Bible is a collection of stories meant to show who God is, or even just the opinions of humans that reveal some commonly-believed truth.{{fact|date=February 2010}}

The issue of &quot;who is a Christian?&quot; can be very controversial.  Christians often disagree over this issue due to their differences in opinion on spiritual matters. It is not possible to provide a statement that all readers may agree with, therefore, a definition will not be provided.  Even very traditional doctrines such as the belief that Jesus Christ is God, or that God consists of the Father, Son, and Spirit, are not common to people who claim Christianity as their religion.

Many Christians choose to go to church. Most Christians believe this to be a sign of their religious devotion to God and an act of worship.  However, some Christian groups think that one can be a Christian without ever going to a church.  Though there are many different viewpoints on the issue, most Protestants believe all Christians are part of the spiritual church of Christ, whether or not those Christians go to an actual church each week.  On the other hand, [[Catholic]]s believe that the Holy Catholic Church is the only true church.

[[File:Various cheeses.jpg|thumb|Some different types of yellow substances]]
'''Cheese''' (strange yellow substance) is milk made into a solid form that you eat. There are many types of cheese. Many things affect the [[style]], [[texture]] and [[flavor]] of a cheese. These include the milk ([[cow]] or [[goat]]), if the milk has been [[Pasteurization|pasteurized]], the amount of [[butterfat]], [[bacteria]] and [[mold]] in the cheese, how the cheese is made and how old the cheese is.

For some cheeses, the milk is [[curd]]led by adding [[acid]]s such as [[vinegar]] or [[lemon]] juice. Most cheeses are acidified by bacteria. This bacteria turns milk [[sugar]]s into [[lactic acid]]. [[Rennet]] is then used to finish the curdling.  [[Vegetarianism|Vegetarian]] alternatives to rennet can also be used. Most of these are made by [[fermentation]] of a [[fungus]] called ''Mucor miehei''. Other alternatives use species of the ''[[Cynara]]'' [[thistle]] [[family (biology)|family]].

== The origin of cheese ==
People have been making cheese since before [[history]] was written down. It is not known when cheese was first made. It is known that cheese was eaten by the [[Sumerians]] in about 4000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenibble.com/REVIEWS/main/cheese/cheese2/history.asp|title=The History Of Cheese: From An Ancient Nomad’s Horseback To Today’s Luxury Cheese Cart |work=The Nibble|publisher=Lifestyle Direct, Inc.|accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cheese is also forbiden to eat by Confucius.

== How cheese is made ==

Cheese is made using milk. The milk of [[cow]]s, [[goat]]s, and [[sheep]] are most popular. [[Buffalo]], [[camel]] and even [[Horse|mare]]'s milk can also be used. Cheese makers usually cook the milk in large [[pot]]s. They add [[salt]] and a [[substance]] from the [[stomach]] of young cows called [[rennet]]. This curdles the cheese and makes it solid. Some makers do not add [[rennet]]. They curdle the cheese in other ways. Cheese made in [[factory|factories]] is often curdled by using bacteria. Other [[ingredients]] are added and the cheese is usually aged for a short time.

== Types of cheese ==
There are many different ways to [[classification|classify]] cheeses. Some ways include:
* How long the cheese was aged 
* The [[texture]] of the cheese. These include Hard, Soft and Softer.
* How the cheese was made
* What type of [[milk]] was used to make the cheese. This is mainly what [[animal]] the milk comes from. The [[diet]] of the animal can also affect the type of cheese made from its milk.
* How much [[fat]] is in the cheese
* What color the cheese is

There are also man-made foods that some people use instead of cheese. These are called [[Cheese analogue]]s.

Different types of cheese include:

{{Other uses|constitutions in general|the US Constitution|United States Constitution}}

The '''constitution''' of a [[country]] (or a [[state]]) is a special type of [[law]] [[document]] that tells how its [[government]] is supposed to work. It tells how the country's [[leader]]s are to be chosen and how long they get to stay in [[office]], how new laws are made and old laws are to be changed or removed based on law, what kind of people are allowed to [[vote]] and what other [[rights]] they are guaranteed, and how the constitution can be changed.

Limits are put on the Government in how much power they have within the Constitution ''(see [[Rule of Law]] )''. On the other hand, countries with repressive or corrupt governments frequently do not stick to their constitutions, or have bad constitutions without giving freedom to citizens and others. This can be known as [[dictatorship]] or simply &quot;bending the rules&quot;. A Constitution is often a way of uniting within a [[Federation]].

The [[United Kingdom|UK's]] constitution is not written in one single [[wikt:document|document]] like many other countries' are. In fact, the UK's constitution is not completely written down at all. Some of it can be found in writing, starting with the [[Magna Carta]] of 1215 and the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights Act 1689]] and including more modern [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]]. Other parts of it are considered [[common law]] and are made up of the decisions of [[judge]]s over many hundreds of years in a system called legal or [[Judiciary|judicial]] [[Precedent|precedence]]. Because of this, some people say that the [[United Kingdom]] has a ''[[de facto]]'' or &quot;unwritten&quot; constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnett|first=H.|title=Constitutional and Administrative Law|publisher=Cavendish|location=London|year=2005|edition=5|pages=9|quote=Conversely, &quot;A written constitution is one contained within a single document or a [finite] series of documents, with or without amendments&quot;, ''id''.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[United States]] in 1787 began a trend in the writing of constitutions. The [[United States Constitution]] is also the shortest that people are still using, and it has been changed (amended) many times over the years. It was made after the colonists won their independence from Britain. At first they had the [[Articles of Confederation]] but the Articles were replaced with today's Constitution.

The Indian constitution is the longest ever written constitution in the world. It  has 395 Articles and 12 Schedules in it, divided into 22 parts. It has been amended more than 100 times.

      <comment>added that a circle is regular shape</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Circle - black simple.svg|thumb|A circle]]

A '''circle''' is a [[round]], regular, [[2D|two-dimensional]] shape, shaped like the letter o.

The [[centre]] of a circle is the point in the very middle.

The [[radius]] of a circle is a line from the centre of the circle to a point on the side.  

All [[point (geometry)|point]]s on the edge of the circle are at the same [[distance]] from the centre.  In other words, the radius is the same length all the way around the circle.  Mathematicians use the letter ''r'' for the length of a circle's radius.

The [[diameter]] (meaning &quot;all the way across&quot;) of a circle is a straight line that goes from one side to the opposite and right through the centre of the circle.  Mathematicians use the letter ''d'' for the length of this line.

The diameter of a circle is equal to twice its radius (''d'' equals 2 times ''r'').

:&lt;math&gt;
d = 2\ r 
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[circumference]] (meaning &quot;all the way around&quot;) of a circle is the line that goes around the centre of the circle.  Mathematicians use the letter ''C'' for the length of this line.

The number ''[[pi (mathematical constant)|π]]'' (written as the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[letter]] ''pi'') is a very useful number. It is the length of the circumference divided by the length of the diameter (''π'' equals ''C'' divided by ''d''). As a fraction the number π is equal to about {{frac|22|7}} and as a number it is about 3.14

{|
|-
|||&lt;math&gt;\pi = \frac{C}{d}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\therefore&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;C = 2\pi \, r&lt;/math&gt;
|}
[[File:CircleArea.gif|thumb|right]]
The [[area]], ''a'', inside a circle is equal to the radius multiplied by itself, then multiplied by π (''a'' equals π times ''r'' times ''r'').

:&lt;math&gt;A = \pi \, r^2 &lt;/math&gt;

==Calculating π==
'''π''' can be measured by drawing a large circle, then measuring its diameter (''d'') and circumference (''C''). This is because the circumference of a circle is always π times its diameter.

&lt;math&gt;\pi = \frac{C}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

'''π''' can also be calculated by only using mathematical methods.  Most methods used for calculating the value of π have desirable mathematical properties. However, they are hard to understand without knowing [[trigonometry]] and [[calculus]].  However, some methods are quite simple, such as this form of the [[Gottfried Leibniz|Gregory-Leibniz]] [[series]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \pi = \frac{4}{1}-\frac{4}{3}+\frac{4}{5}-\frac{4}{7}+\frac{4}{9}-\frac{4}{11}\cdots &lt;/math&gt;

While that series is easy to write and calculate, it is not easy to see why it equals π.  An easier to understand approach is to draw an imaginary circle of radius '''r''' centered at the origin.  Then any point (''x'',''y'') whose distance '''d''' from the origin is less than '''r''', calculated by the [[pythagorean theorem]], will be inside the circle:

:&lt;math&gt; d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Finding a set of points inside the circle allows the circle's area '''A''' to be estimated. For example, by using integer coordinates for a big '''r'''. Since the area '''A''' of a circle is π times the radius squared, π can be approximated by using:

:&lt;math&gt; \pi = \frac{A}{r^2} &lt;/math&gt;

'''Cuba''' is an island country in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. The country is made up of the big [[island]] of Cuba, the [[Isla de la Juventud]] island, and many [[archipelagos|smaller islands]]. [[Havana]] is the capital of Cuba. It is the largest city. The second largest city is [[Santiago de Cuba]]. In Spanish, the capital is called &quot;La Habana&quot;. Cuba is near the [[United States]], [[Mexico]], [[Haiti]], [[Jamaica]] and the [[Bahamas]]. People from Cuba are called Cubans. The official language is [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Cuba has a warm climate, but has many [[hurricane]]s every year.  

In 1492, [[Christopher Columbus]] landed on the island of Cuba. He claimed it for the [[Kingdom of Spain]]. Cuba became a Spanish colony until the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898. After the war, it was part of the [[United States]]. It gained independence in 1902.

== Culture ==
Cuba is famous for many types of music, especially dance music such as the [[Salsa]] and [[Mambo (rhythm)|Mambo]]. Because Cubans come from Spain, Africa, South America and North America, Cuban music is special and different.

Reading is very popular in Cuba. Many people especially enjoy reading books or things that come from outside the country, even though the government does not approve of this. They also love [[music]] and [[sport]]s. Cuban music is very lively. This is because a lot of it comes from African and Spanish rhythms. [[Baseball]], [[basketball]], and [[Track and field athletics|athletics]] events are loved by many Cuban people. The cuban football-team took at one Football-World-Cup part. In 1938, they reached the quartar-final and lost against [[Sweden]] 0:8.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifepac&quot;/&gt;

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Before Cuba was conquered by the Spaniards, three tribes lived on the island. They were the Taínos, the Ciboneys, and the Guanajatabeyes. The Taínos were the largest and most common of the three tribes. They farmed crops such as beans, corn, squash, and yams. The Taínos also slept in hammocks which the Spaniards would introduce to the rest of the world. Then, in 1492, [[Christopher Columbus]] arrived in Cuba on his first trip to the Americas. Three years later he claimed the islands for the Spanish. The Spanish began to rule Cuba afterwards. The Spanish brought thousands of slaves from Africa to Cuba to work for them. Most of the native Cubans died because of the new diseases brought by the Spanish and Africans. The Spanish also treated the native Cubans very cruelly and massacred many of them. 

The Spanish ruled for many years. Cuba became the most important producer of sugar. In the 19th century, Cubans rebelled against the Spanish rulers, but failed until 1898, when the United States went to war with the Spanish and defeated them. Cuba became American for four years afterwards, before it became an independent [[republic]] in [[1902]]. Even though Cuba was independent, the Americans still controlled the island by a law called the [[Platt Amendment]]. In 1933 the Cubans stopped the Platt Amendment, but the Americans still had a big say in Cuban politics. Americans owned most of Cuba’s businesses. The Americans supported the leader Fulgencio Batista, who was seen by many Cubans as corrupt.

=== Cuban Revolution ===
In 1959, [[Fidel Castro]] led a revolution against [[Fulgencio Batista]]. Castro took power of Cuba with [[Che Guevara]] from [[Argentina]], his brother Raul, and others who fought against Batista. Castro made many changes to Cuba and ended American ownership of Cuban businesses. This made Castro unpopular in America and the United States banned all contact with Cuba. Many Cubans also went to America because of this. In 1961 the Americans helped some of these Cubans to attack Cuba and remove Castro, but they failed. Castro then asked the Soviet Union to help defend them from the Americans, which they did. The [[Soviet Union]] put nuclear weapons in Cuba and aimed them at America. American President Kennedy demanded that they be removed or a new war would begin. This was known as the ''[[Cuban Missile Crisis]]''. The Soviet Union then removed the missiles when the United States agreed to not continue attacking cuba and remove missiles from Turkey.  

Cuba became a [[communist]] led country like the Soviet Union after this. The Soviet Union bought most of Cuba’s sugar for expensive prices. Cuba spent this money on health, education and the army. This made Cuba’s schools and hospitals some of the best in the world, and the army fought in [[Africa]] to support black Africans against the white South African army. Cuba also supported groups in South America fighting against the dictators of those countries. 

However, the Cuban government began to control most of life in Cuba under the communist system. Disagreeing with the Cuban government and Fidel Castro in public was not allowed. Some Cubans did not like this and tried to leave Cuba. Most Cubans who left went to America. Some Cubans who did not like the government and stayed were put in jail. Many groups from around the world protested against Cuba because of this, and demanded that Fidel Castro give up power. 

In 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed. This meant that Cuba, which had sold most of its products to the Soviet Union, had no money coming into the country. The Americans made the restrictions against contact with Cuba tighter. America said the restrictions on contact would continue unless Fidel Castro gave up power. Cuba became very poor in the 1990s. This became known in Cuba as “The Special Period”. Because of the disaster, Cuba changed to allow less control by the government, more discussion amongst the people, and private shops and businesses. Cuba also tried to get tourists to visit the island. 

In the 2000s, tourism to Cuba began to make money for the island again. Though [[Fidel Castro]] had remained in power, he had passed all duties to his brother Raul after an illness. Fidel Castro is 87 years old and was one of the longest serving heads of state. In 2008, [[Raúl Castro]] became the official president of Cuba.

For military service, men from the age of 16 to 49 years old must go to the army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cu.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook -- Cuba |work=cia.gov |accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics ==
The population of Cuba is close to 13 million. The people of Cuba come from three different groups. The largest group is the descendants of the [[Spain|Spanish]] settlers who came to Cuba. The smallest group is the descendants of the black African slaves who were brought in to do the work and birth children (in the [[barracoon]]) as [[New World]] slaves who could be legally sold into life time bondage in the United States. The middle-sized group is a mix of African and Spanish. The government succeeded in seeing that the three different groups were treated the same. According to a DNA Caribbean Studies Institute, the racial-makeup of the population of Cuba is:

* [[European people|European]] Cubans descend from settlers that came during the very late 15th century and onward. Most white Cubans came from many different parts of [[Spain]], but the most numerous were the [[Canary Islands|Canary Islanders]], [[Andalusia]]ns, and Catalans. There was as well some [[France|French]], [[Italy|Italian]] and [[England|English]] peoples. Whites makeup approximately 30% of Cuba's population as of 2012, and they mostly populate the west part of Cuba, specially cities like [[Havana]] and [[Pinar de Rio Providence|Pinar del Rio]]. These brought with them their language, religions, music and others.

* [[Africa]]ns and [[Mulatto]] Cubans descend from the arrival of African slaves that came from various parts of [[Africa]] but the most numerous were West Africans. There were also more than 500,000 [[Haiti]]ans that came to Cuba during the [[Haitian Revolution]] days. Most Cuban slaves tended to come from the [[Kongo]] and [[Yoruba]] tribes, there were also the Igbos, Ewes, Fons, Fulas, Mandinkas and some others. [[Afro-Cuban]]s range enormously from 33.9 percent to 70 percent of the population, and they are mostly concentrated in the east parts of Cuba. These brought with them their instruments, reigion ([[Santeria]]), and customs to the Cuban culture.

* [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] Cubans are about 3% of the population, however; one must know that a lot of the Southern Spaniard Cuban descendants have good portion of [[Moor]] blood in their family lines; due to the close proximate Spain is to North Africa. Many Mediterranean Cubans came during the 1820s-1880s and sometimes onward. These are most concentrated in the East specially cities like [[Guantanamo Bay]]. They brought much of their foods and cuisines to Cuba and a few vocabularies.

== Health and education ==
Cuba is a [[developing country]], and is often depicted as a very [[Poverty|poor]] country. In some aspects, however, like [[education]], [[health care]] and [[life expectancy]] it ranks much better than most countries in Latin America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvard&quot;&gt;[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/review/review_summer_02/txt677cuba.html Harvard Public Health Review/Summer 2002] The Cuban Paradox&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[infant death rate]] is lower than some developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html |title=CIA World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average life expectancy is 78 years.&lt;ref name=factbook/&gt;

All the children are required to go to school from six to twelve years old, and nearly everybody is able to read and write at least. There is free education at every level. Because of this,&lt;ref name = &quot;LiteracyC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/latin-lessons-what-can-we-learn-from-the-worldrsquos-most-ambitious-literacy-campaign-2124433.html |title=Latin lessons: What can we Learn from the World’s most Ambitious Literacy Campaign? |publisher=The Independent |date=2010-11-07 |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuba has a 99.8% [[literacy rate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/SeriesDetail.aspx?srid=656&amp;crid=192 |title=unstats &amp;#124; Millennium Indicators |publisher=Mdgs.un.org |date=2010-06-23 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[World Food Programme]] certified Cuba to be the only country in this region without undernourished children. In the same year, the [[United Nations]] said that Cuba was the only nation in the world that met the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]]'s definition of [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Living Planet Report 2006 |url= http://assets.panda.org/downloads/living_planet_report.pdf |publisher= [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], [[Zoological Society of London|ZSL]], [[Global Footprint Network]] |date= 24 October 2006 |page= 19 |accessdate= 18 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
{{see also|List of cities in Cuba}}
Cuba is the largest island in the West Indies. It has many resources. Only about one-fourth of the land is mountains or hills. Much of the land is gentle hills or plains which are good for farming or raising cattle. Cuba has fertile soil and a warm climate that makes it great for growing crops.

Sugar is the most important crop of Cuba, and they may get it from the [[sugar cane]]. Sugar cane is the largest cash crop grown in Cuba, and it brings in most of the money. After that, the second is [[tobacco]]. Tobacco is made into [[cigar]]s by hand. A hand-made cigar is considered by many people to be the finest in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifepac&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Buskey|first=Theresa|title=History and Geography|editor=Alan Christopherson, M.S.|publisher=Alpha Omega Publications, Inc|location=804 N. 2nd Ave. E., Rock Rapids|series=LIFEPAC|pages=11|isbn=978-1-58095-158-6|accessdate=14 April 2010|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important crops are [[rice]], [[coffee]], and [[fruit]]. Cuba also has many minerals. [[Cobalt]], [[nickel]], [[iron]], [[copper]], and [[manganese]] are all on the island. Salt, [[petroleum]], and natural gas are there too.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifepac&quot;/&gt; The coast of Cuba has many [[bay]]s and a few good harbors. Havana, which is the capital, is also a [[Harbour|port]]. Other harbors have port cities. Nuevitas is a port city on the north [[coast]]. Cienfuegos, Guantánamo, and Santiago de Cubaare some of the port cities on the south coast.

Cuba has a semi-tropical climate. That means that the cool ocean winds keep it becoming hot, despite its being in the tropiocal zone. Cuba has a wet season and a dry season. The dry season is from November to April, and the wet season is from May to October. August to October is also the hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean. Because of this, most of Cuba's port cities can be flooded along the coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifepac&quot;/&gt;

A '''cube''' is a block with all [[right angle]]s and whose [[height]], [[width]] and [[depth]] are all the same. 

A cube is one of the simplest [[Platonic solid|mathematical shape]]s in space. Something that is shaped like a cube is sometimes referred to as ''cubic''.

== Relative 2-dimensional shape ==
The basic difference between a cube and a [[Square (geometry)|square]] is, a cube is a [[3D]] figure (having 3 [[dimension]]s  i.e. length, breadth and height while a square has only 2 dimensions i.e. length and breadth.
The 2-dimensional ([[2D]]) shape (like a circle, square, triangle, etc.) that a cube is made of is [[square (geometry)|squares]]. The sides (faces) of a cube are squares. The edges are straight [[line]]s. The corners (vertices) are at right angles. A cube has 8 corners, 12 edges and 6 sides.example dice having six number denotes 6 faces. A [[tesseract]] carries this idea into the fourth dimension ([[4D]]) and is made of 8 cubes. 

== Volume ==
* The [[volume]] of a cube is the [[length]] of any one of the edges (they are all the same length so it does not matter which edge is used) ''cubed''. 
* This means you multiply the number by itself, and then by itself again. 
* If the edge is named 'd' (See Diagram), the equation would be this: Volume=d×d×d (or Volume=d&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

== Cubic shaped things ==

'''December''' is the twelfth and last [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]], with 31 [[day]]s, coming between [[November]] (of the same year) and [[January]] (of the next year). With the name of the month coming from the [[Latin]] ''decem'' for &quot;ten&quot;, it was the tenth month of the year before [[January]] and [[February]] were added to the [[Julian calendar|Roman calendar]].

December begins on the same day of the week as [[September]], and ends on the same day as [[April]], every year.

December's [[flower]] is the [[Daffodil|Narcissus]]. Its [[birthstone]] is the [[turquoise]]. The meaning of the turquoise is [[prosperity]].{{fact|date=December 2012}}

Some of the [[holiday]]s [[wikt:celebrate|celebrated]] in December are [[Christmas]], [[New Year's Eve]], [[Kwanzaa]], and [[Hanukkah]].

== The Month ==
[[File:Weihnachtsmarktindresden.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A [[Christmas]] market in [[Dresden]], [[Germany]] in December]]
December is the 12th and last month of every [[calendar]] year in the [[Gregorian calendar]], and is one of seven months of the year to have 31 days. [[December 31]] is followed by [[January 1]] of the following year. It begins on the same day of the week as [[September]] every year, as [[September 1]] and [[December 1]] are exactly 13 [[week]]s (91 [[day]]s) apart. It ends on the same day as [[April]] of the same year. If the following year is a [[leap year]], then [[March]] of that year would start and end on the same day of the week as December of the year that came before. [[November]] of the following year would then start on the same day of the week as December of the current year. If the following year is a [[common year]], then December of the current year starts on the same day of the week as [[June]] of that year.

The month of December has a [[solstice]], and in this month the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] is turned towards the [[Sun]], meaning that [[December 21]] or [[December 22]] is the Northern [[Winter Solstice]] and the Southern [[Summer Solstice]]. This means that this date would have the least daylight of any day in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and the most in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. There are 24 hours of darkness at the [[North Pole]] and 24 hours of daylight at the [[South Pole]]. In each [[hemisphere]], December is the seasonal equivalent of [[June]] in the other.

In mainly Christian countries, December is dominated by [[Christmas]], which is celebrated on [[December 25]] in most of those countries, though Eastern Orthodox Christians celebrate it on [[January 7]]. It marks the birth of [[Jesus Christ]]. [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], [[January 6]], is also important in relation to Christmas. [[Advent]] starts on the [[Sunday]] on, or closest to, [[November 30]], and some countries have there own related celebration before the 25th. [[Sinterklaas]] is celebrated on [[December 5]] in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]], and St. Nicholas Day on [[December 6]] is also celebrated in some countries. The [[Scandinavia]]n countries, mainly [[Sweden]], celebrate [[St. Lucia Day]] on [[December 13]], while [[Iceland]] celebrates Thorlaksmessa on [[December 23]]. The week after Christmas is spent preparing for [[New Year]].

[[Judaism]]'s festival of light, [[Hanukkah]], is also celebrated over eight days in this month.

'''Dance''' is when people move to a [[music]]al [[rhythm]]. They may be alone, or in a group. The dance may be informal [[Play (theatre)|play]], part of a [[ritual]], or part of a [[professional]] [[performance]]. There are many kinds of dance, and every human [[society]] has its dances.

Dancing is not a sport, although it does have sporting aspects. Dance is an art. Some people dance to express their feelings and [[emotion]]s. Other people dance to feel better. Dance can be used to tell a [[story]]. In some societies, dance goes with [[song]] as well as music. People who want to learn to dance can go to dance schools. It may take years of practice to become an experienced and flexible dancer.

To plan a dance is called ''[[choreography]]'', done by a [[choreographer]].&lt;ref&gt;Crane Debra &amp; Mackrell, Judith 2000. ''The Oxford Dictionary of Dance''. Oxford University Press, Oxford. [this book only deals with ballet]&lt;/ref&gt; Often this goes with [[music]], and fits into a certain style. Dances may be planned in detail, or they may be whatever dancers feel like doing. However, most dancing does follow some general style or [[pattern]]. One style is the couple dance, where (usually) a man and a woman dance together. Other dances need a whole group of people together to make it work.

== History ==
People have always danced. Every society has its own dances. We have pictures, on [[pottery]] and [[stone]], which show dances from several thousand years ago, in [[Egypt]] and [[Greece]].&lt;ref name=Sachs&gt;Sachs, Curt 1937. ''The world history of the dance''. Norton, N.Y. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Chapter 5&lt;/sup&gt;

Sachs divides early dances into 'Imageless dances' and 'Image dances'. By 'imageless dances' he meant dances which have no set form, but aim at getting the dancers into a state of [[Ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]]. In this state the dancer(s) seem changed, in a [[trance]], and are often thought of (by their society) as being 'possessed by [[spirits]]'. These dances are done on certain occasions: marriage, war, famine, illness or death, and so on. They are found in all early ('primitive') societies.&lt;ref name=Sachs/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p49; 62&lt;/sup&gt;

The 'image dances', according to Sachs, are to do with the world outside the dancer. By imitating an animal or object, the dancer believes he can capture a power and make it useful. To dance in imitation of the animal which is going to be hunted is to become one with them. To imitate the act of [[sex]] is to achieve [[fertility]]. This is the kind of thinking behind an image dance. Sachs points out that societies of this kind do not really understand the connection between [[Causality|cause and effect]]. They really believe the image dances work. The dance type which is used in image dances is [[mime]].&lt;ref name=Sachs/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p49; 77&lt;/sup&gt;

The two styles of dance may be joined together. Fertility dances may involve both ecstatic states and mime. The great dancer [[Nijinsky]] used some of these ideas in his [[choreography]] for the [[ballet]] ''[[Le Sacre du Printemps]]'' (The Rite of Spring), a ballet about the sacrifice of a girl during a primitive celebration of Spring.

Coming to more recent times, the first dance school we know about was opened in 1661 in [[Paris]]. Only men were accepted until 1681. After 1681, women were accepted too. [[Ballroom dance]]s are forms of modern dance. Ballroom dances such as the [[Waltz (International)|waltz]] are done by couples.

Until the 20th century, most ballroom dances were [[sequence dance]]s. The way people moved was planned in set formation. These formations were usually lines or squares. Everyone moved at the same time, and finished at the same time. The music played for a set time, and then stopped. After the invention of the [[Waltz (International)|waltz]], around 1800, another style of dancing developed.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Melusine 1952. ''Historical dances: 12th to 19th centuries''. Dance Books, London.&lt;/ref&gt; In the waltz, and later dances, people danced in couples, but they did so separately. They did not dance in formation, but moved round the room as they pleased (but anti-clockwise). Now, once again, new dance styles have arrived. Some people dance as individuals, separately as they please. [[Street dance]] is like that. But all these types of dance have music.

At the same time, round the world there are many traditional dances. Some of them have been going for hundreds of years. We call them [[folklore|folkloric]] dances.

The '''Dissolution of the monasteries''' was an event that happened from [[1536]] to [[1540]], when [[England|English]] King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] took away the land and money that the nuns and monks of the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] church owned. Henry VIII then gave this land and money to people that supported him.

This was also when Henry VIII made himself the new head of the [[Church of England]] (which is a type of [[Christianity]]).

It all started when Henry VIII wanted to get a divorce but was refused by the Pope.
{{Spoken Wikipedia|Dissolution of the monasteries.ogg|[[19 July]] [[2006]]}}

He decided to create his own religion - the Church of England.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''deadline''' is a [[time]] by which some [[:wikt:task|task]] must be [[:wikt:complete|complete]]d.

Very often, it means a [[time limit]] that is set in place by an [[authority]] - for example, a [[teacher]] tells students that they must turn in their [[:wikt:homework|homework]] in by a certain time. This is so the teacher is able to report fairly to his or her [[principal]] that every [[student]] had the same chance to do the work.

Deadlines may also be set by a [[time horizon]] that comes from something that is not a human authority, but part of [[nature]].  For example, by [[sunset]] one must do those tasks requiring [[daylight]].  However, a human must watch the sun and decide what light is strong enough to still be daylight, so time limits will still be involved even if one observes a horizon and sets a deadline oneself.

A way to remember this is that a time horizon is like the [[Matter|physical]] [[horizon]] where sunset happens and a time limit is a thing people set up to deal with this. A deadline is a thing powerful people set up to ensure less powerful people comply with their way of doing things.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Dutton Speedwords''' is a [[constructed language | made-up language]] written by Reginald John Garfield Dutton. The [[idea]] of '''Dutton Speedwords''' is to make frequent words short, and very frequent words very short. '''Dutton Speedwords''' can be used as a second language for international communications. Dutton Speedwords is also a [[shorthand]] writing system – this means you can use it to write quickly. 

The method was made up by Reginald John Garfield Dutton (1886-1970) in 1922. It was first published in 1935. It was called ''International Symbolic Script''. A year later, it was called ''Speedwords''. It was changed in 1946 and 1951.

It has two uses; to be a language and to be used for writing quickly. Dutton hoped that this would mean more people would learn it because they could use it for two reasons.

The books that Dutton wrote about Speedwords are not printed anymore. But Speedwords is now being used by more people because they find it is good for working [[online]]. For example, it makes it faster to type an [[email]].

Another way of writing quickly is [[Pitman's shorthand]]. This uses special symbols instead of letters. Speedwords uses Roman letters. This makes it easier to learn. It also means it can be typed using a normal keyboard. Each word means only one thing. This means you do not need to use different forms of the same word.

The words used in Speedwords are the same as the words used in many other languages. The words are like short versions of the writer's own language.

In some [[religion]]s, the '''devil''' is a bad [[spirit]] that tries to create problems for people. Some people also use the words &quot;the Devil&quot; or &quot;[[Satan]]&quot; for the most powerful devil. The word &quot;devil&quot; comes from the Greek word &quot;diabolos&quot; which means &quot;someone who tells lies to hurt you&quot;. (&quot;Diabolos&quot; is translated to the English word &quot;[[slander]]er.&quot;) The [[New Testament]] uses &quot;diabolos&quot; as a title for [[Satan]], and so &quot;The Devil&quot; became another name for Satan in English.

In the [[Old Testament]], there is the [[serpent]] and the '''shaitan''', who may be two different characters. &quot;Shaitan&quot; in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] means &quot;adversary&quot;, an enemy or opponent. Shaitan is also the word used for the devil in the [[Koran]], who often appears as an animal and tries to get people to do the wrong thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tfd.com/shaitan |title=shaitan |accessdate=27 December 2009 |format= |work=The Free Dictionary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Christianity]] the Devil was originally an [[angel]] in [[heaven]] called Lucifer. But he wanted to be the ruler of heaven and so he revolted against God. After a hard fight he was defeated and thrown out of heaven. Some other angels who helped him were also thrown out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_devil |title=Devil |accessdate=17 February 2010 |format= |work=Wikipedia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Devil was thrown out of heaven, he started doing bad things on the earth. He wants people to worship him instead of God. Sometimes he tries to trick people by giving them false promises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gospel-mysteries.net/devil-satan.html |title=The Devil |accessdate=17 February 2010 |format= |work=Gospel Mysteries }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other angels who were thrown out of heaven became evil spirits called demons. They obey the Devil and help him do evil things.

The [[Book of Revelation]] says that God will punish the Devil and his demons by throwing them into a Lake of Fire that burns in [[Hell]]. This will happen in the future.

Artists draw pictures of the Devil that show him as ugly and evil. But nobody knows what he may look like. Usually he is a spirit that nobody can see, but he can make himself look like a real person in order to trick people. Many modern depictions of the devil portray him as a red human-like being with [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]] and a pointed [[tail]], carrying a red [[pitchfork]].

Not all religions believe in the devil. For example, [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] do not believe in the devil.{{fact|date=October 2013}} Many [[Satanism|satanists]] believe in the devil or Satan only as a [[metaphor]], not an actual being or person.

'''Diarrhea''' (DIE-uh-REE-uh), also spelled '''diarrhoea''', happens when the body makes more watery [[feces]] than normal. In a [[baby]] it is the most common symptom of [[malnutrition]]. This means not eating enough, or well enough. Diarrhea can occur in humans as well as most other [[mammals]].

Diarrhea is not a [[disease]]. It is a [[wikt:condition|condition]] that a body can be in. However, there are many diseases that can cause your body to have diarrhea. Most are temporary and related to [[diet]] - the [[food]] you [[eat]]. [[Food safety]] and [[hand washing]] can lower the risk of getting diarrhea. [[wikt:stress|Stress]] and drinking too much [[alcohol]] or [[caffeine]] can also cause diarrhea.

In [[developing nation]]s, malnutrition is a common cause of child death.  Part of the deaths from malnutrition are caused by diarrhea. Another way diarrhea can kill you is by [[dehydration]]. Because diarrhea is watery in nature, it takes up a lot of the water in your body. Diarrhea is often treated with [[aspirin]] or [[glucose]] - these reduce [[pain]] and may stop some symptoms for a while. However, if it was because of malnutrition, it will not save the child's life. Spending money on [[rehydrating salts]], clean [[water]], and more food is the most direct way to cure diarrhea from malnutrition.

The opposite of diarrhea, firm feces are a sign of good [[digestive health]]. Many people adopt [[vegetarian]] diets with high [[dietary fibre]] to prevent diarrhea and other digestive problems.

'''Dimensions''' are a concept from [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]: One way to define a dimension is to look at the [[degree of freedom|degrees of freedom]] a movement has in in a specific space. There are different concepts where the term dimension is used and there are also different definitons. There is no definition that can satisfy all concepts. 

In a [[vector space]], a dimension is equal to the  [[cardinality]] of the minimal [[Generator (mathematics)|generator]]. It is also equal to the cardinality of the maximal set of [[linear independence|linearly independent]] [[vector]]s of that space. &quot;Normal&quot; objects in everyday life are specified by three dimenensions, which are usually called [[length]], [[width]] and [[depth]]. Mathematicians call this concept [[Euclidean space]].

Dimensions can be used to measure [[position]] too. The [[distance]] to a position from a [[start]]ing place can be measured in the length, width and height [[direction]]s. These distances are a measure of the position.

Sometimes a fourth ([[4D]]) dimension, [[time]], is used to show the [[position]] of an [[event]] in [[time]] and [[Space (physics)|space]].

==Other Dimensions==
In [[modern]] [[science]], people use other dimensions.

Dimensions like [[temperature]] and [[weight]] can be used to show the position of something in less simple [[Space (physics)|spaces]].

[[Mathematician]]s also use dimensions. In mathematics, dimensions are more general. Dimensions in mathematics might not measure things in the [[world]]. The [[rule]]s for doing [[arithmetic]] with dimensions in mathematics might be different than usual arithmetic rules.

==Dimensions and vectors==
[[Vector]]s are used to show distances and directions. Vectors are often used in [[engineering]] and [[science]], and sometimes in  [[mathematics]].

A vector is a list of [[number]]s. There is one number for each dimension. There are arithmetic rules for vectors.

For example, if Jane wants to know the position of Sally, Sally can give Jane a vector to show the position. If Jane and Sally are in the world, there are three dimensions. Therefore, Sally gives Jane a list of three numbers to show her position. The three numbers in the vector Sally gives Jane might be:
# Sally's distance north of Jane
# Sally's distance east of Jane
# Sally's height above Jane

'''Distance''' is how far one thing is from another thing. Distance is a [[measure]] of the space between two things.

==Examples of Distance==
* One ball is 5 [[Foot (unit of length)|feet]] from another ball. The distance between the two balls is 5 feet.
* John walks [[north]] at 6 [[kilometre]]s per [[hour]] for one hour. John [[walk]]s a distance of 6 kilometres. 
* A [[circle]] is a [[curve]]d [[line]]. Each point on the circle is the same distance from the [[centre]] of the circle.

==Displacement==
Distance is different from [[displacement vector|displacement]]. Displacement is the difference between a starting point and a finishing point. 

==Example of Displacement==
A and B are 1 [[metre]] apart. Tom walks from A to B. Then Tom walks from B back to A. The distance Tom walked is 2 metres. Tom's displacement is 0 metres, because Tom started at A and finished at A.

== Depth in Mathematics ==

In [[list of mathematics topics|math]], the distance between the [[near|nearest]] end and [[far|farthest]] end of an [[wikt:object|object]] is its '''depth'''.

For example, Jane [[measure]]s a [[box]].  When she measures the distance between the end of the box closest to her and the end of the box farthest away, Jane measures the box's depth.

* [[Geometry]]
* [[Width]]
* [[Height]]
* [[Length]]

== Depth in Liquids ==

For [[liquids]], the distance between the top or [[surface]] of the liquid and the bottom of the liquid is the liquid's depth.

For example, [[water]] is a liquid.  If you fill a [[container]] with water, the distance between the top of the water and the bottom of the container is the water's depth.  If the depth is big we say the water is '''deep'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Latin_dictionary.jpg|thumb|250px|Latin dictionary]]
A '''dictionary''' is a [[book]] which explains the meanings of [[word]]s or, more precisely, [[lexeme]]s. The words are arranged in [[alphabetical order]] so that they can be found quickly. The word “dictionary” comes from the [[Latin]] “dictio” (“saying”).

There are several types of dictionaries: dictionaries which explain words and how they are used, dictionaries which translate words from one [[language]] to another, dictionaries of [[biography]] which tell about famous people, technical dictionaries which explain the meanings of technical words or words connected to a particular [[subject (school)|subject]] (sometimes called a [[thesaurus]]). Some of these come close to being an [[encyclopedia]], but an encyclopedia gives a lot of extra information about things (knowledge) and does not explain the use of the language.

== Dictionaries which explain the meaning of words ==
Dictionaries which explain what words mean will give a clear &quot;definition&quot; of the word (e.g. '''''hippopotamus''''' : a [[hoof]]ed [[mammal]] with thick [[skin]], large [[mouth]] and short [[leg]]s that lives in [[river]]s and [[lake]]s of [[Africa]].) 

Good dictionaries will also give more information about the word. It will explain how it is [[pronunciation|pronounced]]. Usually the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] is used for this. It will explain how the word is used. This is not a problem for a word like &quot;hippopotamus&quot;, but a word like &quot;put&quot; has so many different meanings that a large dictionary may have a whole page or more to explain how it can be used. It will also explain what language the word comes from (e.g. Greek &quot;hippos&quot; horse and &quot;potamus&quot; river).

A dictionary may also give the form of the word in different [[grammatical tense|tenses]], [[plural]] form etc.

== Dictionaries which translate into foreign languages ==
There are also dictionaries which translate words into foreign languages. Very often one volume (one book) will translate both ways, so half the book will be translating from English to [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and the other half from Dutch to English.

When using a dictionary to find out how to say something in another language one has to be careful to choose the right word. A word like “right” has two basic meanings in English: 1) “correct”, and 2) the opposite of “left”. Other languages are not like English: they will have different words for these different meanings. A word like “put” has many meanings. A good dictionary will have a large list of these meanings to help people find the word they want. In many languages, for example, the word “put” will be different according to whether something is being put onto something (e.g. a table) or into something (e.g. a cupboard).

== Updating dictionaries ==
Dictionaries need to be updated frequently because of the way language changes. New words are often brought into a language (e.g. lots of [[computer]] terms) or words change their meanings (e.g. “gay” or “cool”). The most famous English Dictionary is the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (or OED). Words are always being added to the OED, they are never taken out even if they are obsolete (not used any more). The OED can be accessed online (with a subscription).

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{wiktionary|definition}}
A '''definition''' is an exact [[word]] or [[phrase]] of the meaning, nature, or limits of something. A definition usually answers the question ''what''. ''Defining'' means giving a definition. Other words with this meaning are ''[[wikt:description|description]]'' and ''[[explanation]]''. It describes what a word means and explains to the person when and where it can be used.

In [[mathematics]], a definition is an exact way of saying what something is.  It might not be the easiest way to say what it is, but it is used because it is exact.  It can be used in a [[mathematical proof]] about the thing.

'''Denmark''' ({{lang-da|Danmark}}), officially named the '''Kingdom of Denmark''', is a [[Nordic countries|Nordic country]] in [[Northern Europe]]. It is the furthest south of the [[Scandinavia]]n countries, to the south of Norway and south-west of Sweden (which it is connected to by a bridge). It has a south border with [[Germany]]. It borders both the [[North Sea]] to the west and the [[Baltic Sea]] to the east. Denmark is a [[developed country]] with a large [[welfare state]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Esping-Andersen&quot;&gt;Esping-Andersen, G. (1990). ''The three worlds of welfare capitalism''. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2006 and 2007, surveys&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=4086092&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt; ranked Denmark as &quot;the happiest place in the world,&quot; based on standards of health, [[welfare]], and [[education]].

The [[capital city]] of Denmark is [[Copenhagen]], on the island of Sealand. Denmark is a [[constitutional monarchy]] (meaning the [[head of state]] is a monarch who has few established powers) with a queen, [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]]. Denmark is a parliamentary state, meaning the people appoint a [[parliament]] to make decisions for them, and it has a [[democracy|democratic government]] headed by an elected Prime Minister, who currently is [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]].

In geography, ''Denmark'' is the land in northern Europe, where the [[Danish people|Danes]] live. In the political sense, the ''Kingdom of Denmark'' also includes the [[Faroe Islands]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and [[Greenland]] in [[North America]]. All three parts of the country have different languages and culture.

== History ==
Denmark was first united in the [[10th century]], during the [[Viking]] period, by the king Harald Bluetooth ({{circa|985}}), who first converted Denmark to [[Christianity]]. The Vikings are well known for invading countries.  In the [[11th century]], the Danish Vikings controlled [[England]] (the [[Danelaw]]) for a while. In 1397 Denmark, Sweden and Norway became a single country with one queen (this country was called the ''Kalmar Union'') Sweden became a separate country again in 1523. Denmark and Norway (called ''Denmark-Norway'', stayed united, until 1814. Denmark-Norway controlled many islands in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], including the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Iceland]] and [[Greenland]]. Iceland became [[independent]] from Denmark in 1944.

[[File:Grundlovgivende rigsforsamling - Constantin Hansen.jpg|thumb|left|Meeting to write the constitution, 1848.]]
Denmark became a [[constitutional monarchy]] in [[June 5]], [[1849]] when it adopted a [[constitution]] which took away powers from the King and gave rights to ordinary Danish people. [[June 5]] is  now a holiday in Denmark, called &quot;Constitution Day&quot;.

Over the years Denmark lost many of lands that it controlled in battle. Denmark's biggest war defeat was the ''Second Schleswig War'' (in 1864) when the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein was conquered by the Kingdom [[Prussia]] (now a part of [[Germany]]). This was a big loss for Denmark and, consequently, it began a policy of [[neutral]]ity after the loss, meaning it would no longer take part in any wars or support other countries. Denmark did not take part in the [[First World War]]. 

On [[April 9]], [[1940]], Denmark was invaded by [[Nazi Germany]] and the Nazis stayed in Denmark throughout [[World War II]]. During the war, in 1943, Danes helped over 8,000 [[Jews]] to escape from Denmark into Sweden after the Nazis tried to arrest them. 

After the liberation of Denmark, one part of the country was not. That was the island of [[Bornholm]]. The German Commandant ''von Kamptz'' who was stationed there, refused to surrender to the Soviets as the German were fleeing to Bornholm and further to Sweden. The Soviets then bombed the two biggest towns [[Rønne]] and [[Nexø]]. After the Germans were captured on May 9, 1945, the Soviet Army occupied the island until April 6, 1946.

After World War Two, Denmark became a member of [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]]. Greenland and the Faroe Islands are now part of the ''Kingdom of Denmark'' and have their own governments and limited power.

== Government and politics ==
[[File:Helle Thorning-Schmidt-2.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]], the Prime Minister of Denmark.]]
Denmark has three branches of power; the [[judiciary]] (the courts), the executive (the Prime Minister and the cabinet) and the [[legislature]] (the [[Folketing|Danish parliament]]). The current Prime Minister of Denmark is [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]], who was [[election|elected]] in September 2011 She is the first woman prime minister of Denmark.

Denmark is a Kingdom which means it has a [[monarchy|monarch]] (a king or queen). The current monarch is Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]]. Margrethe II does not have a lot of power (she does not make any important decisions) and has a symbolic role. Denmark became a [[constitutional monarchy]] in 1849.

Elections to the [[Folketing|parliament]] are held every four years, and the winner of the election is the party or coalition which gets the most votes and seats in the parliament. After the elections are done, several parties who are in agreement will group together to form a [[coalition]] [[government]], and the leader of the largest party becomes the prime minister.

Here is a short summary of the biggest political parties in Denmark, from left to right on the [[Politics#Left-wing and right-wing political parties|political axis]]:

* Red-Green Alliance (Danish: ''Enhedslisten''), a [[communism|communist]] party.
* Socialist People's Party (Danish: ''Socialistisk Folkeparti''), a [[socialist]] party.
* [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] (Danish: ''Socialdemokraterne''), a [[left-wing]] party which is &quot;[[social democracy|social democratic]]&quot; (slightly socialist).
* Danish Social Liberal Party (Danish: ''Det Radikale Venstre''), a [[liberal]] party.
* [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]], Liberal Party of Denmark (Danish: ''Venstre''), a slightly [[right-wing]] liberal party.
* Conservative People's Party (Danish: ''Det Konservative Folksparti''), a [[conservatism|conservative]] party.
* Danish People's Party (Danish ''Dansk Folkeparti''), a [[right-wing]] political party who dislike [[immigration]] (people from other countries who come to live in Denmark).

=== Welfare ===
Denmark, like the other [[Nordic countries]]. is well known for being a large [[welfare]] state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Esping-Andersen&quot; /&gt; The government provides many services to the public such as free [[health care]], free [[education]] (school and college) and free housing for the poor. Danes pay high taxes to fund welfare.

== Geography ==
{{see also|List of cities in Denmark}}
[[File:Da-map.png|thumb|left|Map of Denmark]]
Denmark is the smallest of the [[Scandinavia]]n countries. The neighbours are [[Germany]] (to the south), [[Sweden]] (to the east), [[Norway]] (to the north) and the [[United Kingdom]] (to the west). The country is surrounded by the sea except for Jutland (''Jylland''), the largest part of Denmark. It is connected to Germany by land. To the south-east there is the [[Baltic Sea]], to the west the [[North Sea]], to the north the [[Skagerrak]] and to the north-east the [[Kattegat]].

The western part of Denmark is the [[peninsula]] of [[Jutland]] ({{lang-da|Jylland}}, pronounced ''yoo´-land''), bordering Germany. This is the only part of Denmark that is not an island. The rest of Denmark includes 76 islands people live on, and many tiny islands. The largest islands are Zealand (''Sjælland''), and Funen (''Fyn''). To the east is the island of [[Bornholm]] in the [[Baltic Sea]], the only place in Denmark where the bedrock can be seen.

The country is quite flat. The highest hill or mountain is Møllehøj, which is 170.86 metres (560.56&amp;nbsp;ft) tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Danmarks nye top|journal=Aktuel Naturvidenskab | first=Jørgen | last=Dahlgaard | volume=2005|issue=1|page=2|url = http://www.aktuelnat.au.dk/pdf05_1/an1top.pdf |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080307040437/http://www.aktuelnat.au.dk/pdf05_1/an1top.pdf |archivedate = 7 March 2008|format=PDF|accessdate=20 January 2012|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many small hills, lakes, creeks, forests and farmland. Denmark's shore line covers 7,314&amp;nbsp;km (4,545&amp;nbsp;mi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://denmark.dk/portal/page?_pageid=374,520337&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070403235436/http://denmark.dk/portal/page?_pageid=374,520337&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|archivedate=3 April 2007 |title=Nature &amp; Environment |accessdate=19 January 2012|work=Denmark.dk }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobody in Denmark lives more than 60&amp;nbsp;km from the coast.

=== Climate ===
The [[weather]] in Denmark is quite windy and rainy. In the [[winter]], it does not get very cold; in most years, there are only a few weeks of [[snow]]. Every ten years or so, the sea around the islands freezes over, but in most winters, it does not. The [[climate]] and [[topography]] are not good for winter sports.

Most [[summer]]s are not very hot. People always dress to be ready for rain or wind. There are also very sunny times, but nobody can know ahead of time when these will be. The best time of the year for outdoor activities is the months of May and June until midsummer.

=== Regions and municipalities ===
[[File:Map DK Regions2.png|thumb|left|A map of the regions of Denmark]]
Denmark is divided into five regions ([[Danish language|Danish]]: ''regioner'' or ''region'' for one). The regions replaced the former counties (''amter'') in January 2007. The regions are in charge of hospitals and health care.

|}

The regions are then subdivided into municipalities ({{lang-da|kommuner}}). There are currently 98 municipalities, but before January 2007 there were 275. The number of municipalities was decreased when it was decided that, to become more efficient, each should have a population of at least 20,000 .

== People ==
[[File:Denmark-demography.png|thumb|left|175px|Population changes in Denmark the last 45 years]]
The biggest part (90.5%) of Denmark's population of just under 5.4 million is of Danish descent, according to 2009 statistics. Of the rest 8.9% who are immigrants or descendent from recent immigrants, many come from [[South Asia]] or the [[Middle East]]. There are also small groups of [[Inuit]] from [[Greenland]] and [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DSTimm&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dst.dk/HomeUK/Statistics/focus_on/focus_on_show.aspx?sci=565 |title=Immigrants and their descendants and foreign nationals|work=Statistics Denmark |publisher=Dst.dk |date=12 May 2010 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danes speak the national language, [[Danish language|Danish]], which is very similar to the other [[Scandinavia]]n languages. Swedish and Norwegian are so close to Danish that most Danes understand them. 

As well as Danish, most Danes speak a foreign language too, such as [[English language|English]], which is popular as an [[international]] language, or [[German language|German]]. In the southern part of Jutland, a German minority speaks [[German language|German]]. On the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] is spoken, and people living in [[Greenland]] speak [[Greenlandic language|Inuit]]. 

Religion does not play a large part in the life of most Danes and church attendance is very low. However, even though many Danes are [[atheist]], 80.4%&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.km.dk/folkekirken/statistik-og-oekonomi/kirkestatistik.html Membership Lutheran state church] (''Danish'').&lt;/ref&gt; are members of the Protestant &quot;Church of Denmark&quot; ({{lang-da|Folkekirke}} (The National Church) which is the official &quot;state church&quot; of Denmark. The National Church is [[Lutheran]], which means it separated from the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the [[16th Century]]. Other important faiths include [[Judaism]], [[Islam]] (the number of Muslims is increasing), other Protestant groups and Catholicism.

== Transport ==
[[File:Storebaeltbroen.JPG|thumb|Great Belt Fixed Link is the biggest bridge in Denmark]] 
Because of the many islands, Denmark has many [[bridge]]s. The main parts of the country, and most of the bigger islands, are connected by [[road]]s and [[railroad]]s. One of the world's longest bridges connects the eastern and the western parts of the country, and there is a large bridge to Sweden also. There is still no bridge across the Baltic Sea to Germany, but it will most likely be built in a few years.  The bridge to Sweden was expensive, took a long time to build, and required much planning by engineers.

There are still many islands with no bridges to the mainland. People have to go by [[boat]] or [[airplane]] to reach these islands. Many islands will never be reached by bridges, because they are too small or too far away.  If the island has too few people, bridges are often not built because it is expensive to build.  Somebody has to pay for it, nothing is free.

[[Cycling]] is very popular in Denmark because the ground is so flat. [[Copenhagen]] is a city that is very bicycle friendly, with bicycle lanes extending over 12,000&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.visitdenmark.dk/danmark/da-dk/menu/turist/inspiration/aktivferie/cykel/cykel-ruter-og-regioner.htm | title = Cykelruter og regioner | accessdate = 20 January 2012 | publisher=Visitdenmark.com | language = Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
The people of Denmark have always depended on the sea. In earlier days, people could not travel anywhere unless they went by boat. Many Danes were [[fishing|fishermen]] or [[merchant]]s. Even today, many Danes spend much time near or at the sea.

[[Farm]]ing has always been one of the main [[Profession|occupations]]. Because of the [[climate]] and the [[soil]], Denmark is a good place for [[agriculture]]. [[Export]] of food to the neighbouring countries is one of the most important sources of [[income]] for the country.  Danish hams and cookies are exported throughout the world.

Perhaps the most famous Dane is actually [[Hamlet]], the title character of [[William Shakespeare]]'s famous play, which was set in the real castle of Kronborg in [[Helsingør]], north of Copenhagen. The play was based on an old Danish myth of the [[Viking]] Prince Amled of Jutland, and his quest for revenge against his father's killer. Another widely known Dane is [[Hans Christian Andersen]], an [[author]] mostly famous for such [[fairy tale]]s as &quot;[[The Little Mermaid]]&quot;, and &quot;[[The Ugly Duckling]]&quot;. Also [[Karen Blixen]], [[Tycho Brahe]] and the philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] are well-known world wide. There are many famous Danish scientists, including [[Niels Bohr]], the famous physicist who developed the first working model for the [[atom]], and [[Ole Rømer]], who discovered the [[speed of light]]. Hans Kirk, although less well-known outside of Denmark, is the author of the best-selling Danish novel of all time, ''The Fishermen''.

=== Music ===
Danes enjoy many different types of music, including [[ballet]]s, [[jazz music]], [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music|rock]]. Denmark's most famous [[classical music|classical]] [[composer]] is probably  [[Carl Nielsen]]. Famous Danish bands include [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]], a pop band, and [[The Raveonettes]], an indie rock band. The most famous Danish rock star is [[Lars Ulrich]] of the band [[Metallica]]. 

=== Food  ===
[[File:Smørrebrød 5.jpg|thumb|170px|Danish open sandwich (''smørrebrød'') on dark rye bread. A popular food item in Denmark.]] 
The [[cuisine]] of Denmark is like the other Nordic countries ([[Finland]], [[Norway]], [[Iceland]], and [[Sweden]]), as well as that of northern [[Germany]], consists mainly [[pork]] [[meat]] and [[fish]]. Traditional Danish food includes ''frikadeller'' (fried [[meatball]]s, often served with [[potato]]es and various sorts of [[sauce|gravy]]). Fish is also widely eaten, especially on the west coast of [[Jutland]].

=== Holidays ===
[[Christmas]] ({{lang-da|Jul}}) is the main feast of the year. Christmas is traditionally celebrated on the eve, [[December 24]], and this is when the main Christmas meal is eaten and presents are unwrapped.

In midwinter, a [[fasting|fast]] is celebrated. Children are dressed up, and go from house to house begging for money. This practice has in the recent years been taken over by [[Halloween]], and most people give candy not money. A barrel filled with candy is smashed with clubs. The person who makes the candy fall out is appointed queen of cats and the person who hits the last stick is appointed king of cats.

Midsummer is celebrated with a huge bonfire in the evening of [[June 23]]. Most Danes have a three week summer holiday in July or August.

=== Sports ===
The most popular sport in Denmark is [[Football (soccer)|football]] (soccer). Sailing, swimming and other water sports are very popular because of the long coastline. Another common sport is cycling, (Copenhagen has been nicknamed the &quot;City of Cyclists&quot; because of the popularity of bicycles for moving around), which has become popular in Denmark partly because of the flat land all over the country. Indoor sports such as badminton and handball are also popular during the long winters.

== Monarchy ==
[[File:Royal Wedding Stockholm 2010-Konserthuset-421.jpg|thumb|right|Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark]] (left) and her husband, Prince Henrik (right).]]
[[Monarch]] is a word that means [[king]] or [[queen]]. Denmark is the oldest monarchy in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nettyroyal.nl/denmark2.html Danish Royal Family]. Nettyroyal.nl.&lt;/ref&gt;  The current monarch is [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe II]], who has been the queen since [[1972]]. Denmark does not currently have a [[King]]. Margrethe's husband is called a [[prince]] because he is the son-in-law, not the [[son]], of the previous King.  The royal couple have two [[children]]:
* Crown Prince Frederik who married an [[Australia]]n woman named [[Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark|Mary]], and have two children:&lt;/b&gt;
** Prince Christian&lt;/b&gt;
** Princess Isabella&lt;/b&gt;
* Joachim married a [[British]] woman from [[Hong Kong]] but later divorced in 2005 after being married for 10 years. he has two sons:&lt;/b&gt;
** Prince Nikolai&lt;/b&gt;
** Prince Felix&lt;/b&gt;
In 2008 Prince Joachim  married for the second time. His new wife is from [[France]] and is called Marie, with whom he has a son and a daughter.
** Prince Henrik&lt;/b&gt;
** Princess Athena

'''Death''' is the end of [[life]] in an [[organism]]. All [[Biology|biological]] [[function]]s of the living thing stop, including the [[mind]] and the [[senses]]. The usual [[Signs and symptoms|signal]] for death is that the [[heart]] stops beating and cannot be restarted. This can be caused by many things. All living things have a limited lifespan, and all living things eventually die.

Living things which have died are normally described as being '''dead'''. Death of humans is often investigated for the cause, in case of [[crime]] (such as [[murder]]) or [[disease]] that may continue to kill other humans. About 150,000 people die every day around the world.&lt;ref name=degrey&gt;{{cite journal | last = Aubrey D.N.J | first = de Grey | authorlink = | title = Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations | journal = Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1, Article 5 | year = 2007 | url = http://www.mfoundation.org/files/sens/ENHANCE-PP.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.2202/1941-6008.1011 | accessdate = March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; About two thirds of these people die because of [[ageing|age]].&lt;ref name=degrey/&gt; In addition to the physical body, some believe humans also have a [[soul]] and believe that the soul can continue without a body ([[afterlife]]), move into another body ([[reincarnation]]), or cease to exist ([[annihilationism]]). [[Religion]]s have different beliefs about this issue. Many cultures have their own [[custom]]s and [[ritual]]s to respect the dead.

When people talk about things or events that lead to the death of a plant or animal, those things or events are usually described as being deadly, or fatal. In the case of diseases, they are described as ''terminal''. Humans are no different from any other lifeform. Our bodies have an ability for self-repair, but that ability is limited. Finding the cause of death is a medical speciality called [[pathology]]. In [[medicine]], death is when the heart stops beating for more than several minutes. There are special times in which people recover even though the heart has stopped for 30 minutes, such as near-drowning in very cold water. If machines are used to help the heart and lungs work, then the moment of death is more difficult to know.

== Society and culture ==
[[File:Placid death.JPG|thumb|Dead bodies can be [[Mummification|mummified]] either naturally or by intention.]]
In any society, human death is surrounded by [[ritual]] - a [[Funeral|wake]] or [[funeral]] is normal.  In some places it was common to ''eat'' the dead in a form of [[ritual]] [[cannibalism]].  But this is no longer common, in part because [[disease]] like [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]] can be passed this way. Human dead bodies are [[taboo]] in most societies and must be handled in special ways - for a combination of religious and [[hygiene]] reasons.  A human dead body must always be reported in [[law]], to be sure it is disposed of properly.

=== Dealing with dead bodies and their property ===

Finding the cause of any human death and stopping a similar death from happening to someone else are the main reasons people look into ''[[human morbidity]]'' or let dead bodies be cut open and looked at in an [[autopsy]].  Some religions do not allow autopsies, because they feel the body is holy. Autopsies are usually required by the [[state]] if someone dies and people do not know why. The autopsy helps find out if someone killed the person on purpose, tried to hurt them, or if they died from a sickness.

To prepare for their own death, humans can write a [[last will and testament]] to be clear about who gets their [[property]].  A person will sometimes also volunteer to be an [[organ donor]]. This might mean giving the whole body to [[medical research]].  It can also save the lives of others by making [[organ transplant]]s possible.

=== Religious views of death ===

For a long time, many people have been afraid of death and a lot of people have wondered about what may happen to people after they die.  This is one of the largest questions of [[philosophy]] and [[religion]]. Many people believe there is some form of [[afterlife]].

Ancient rulers sometimes did insist not only that their own bodies, and much property, but even their servants and relatives be destroyed at their funeral.  In [[India]] this ritual still does sometimes occur.  Old women sometimes carry guns in case their husband's relatives come to throw them on the funeral fire.

[[Christianity]] has a special focus on death because of the state killing of [[Jesus Christ]] by the Romans.  In [[Islam]] this is thought to demonstrate the injustice of human systems of dealing out death, and the ability of the best people to overcome it and even forgive it{{fact|date=March 2013}}.  In [[Christianity]] itself it is thought to prove that Jesus himself was really [[God]] and so could lose his body and still have the power of [[resurrection]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Gospel of John]] 10:38&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Buddhism]] [[reincarnation]] is believed to occur. Reincarnation is an idea taken from [[Hinduism]].

[[Confucianism]] advises respect for parents and forms of [[ancestor]] [[worship]] to respect both dead and living ancestors.

=== Rituals surrounding death ===

Every [[ethical tradition]] including the medical view of the body has some ritual surrounding death.  Often these excuse behaviours that might be hated if they did not have the ritual.  For instance, one may say that [[organ transplant]] is like [[cannibalism]].

Very much of what happens at a human death is ritual.  People who wish theirs to be dealt with a certain way, and who wish a particular treatment like [[cremation]] of their body, should decide in advance and set up the necessary payments and agreements.  This makes it much easier for their family after they die, since there is no longer the ability to clearly communicate the wish.

For the same reason, saying goodbye is important.  Most of the [[wikt:stress|stress]] of death seems to come for loved ones who &quot;did not have a chance to say goodbye&quot;.

Maybe it is to relieve this stress that rituals are created, and to bring together those that knew someone so that the personal experience a person can no longer communicate for themselves, can be exchanged by others.

Some ritual, such as seances, claim to allow people to speak to the dead. This is not claimed to be very reliable, both by [[scientists]] and even by those who do them very often.

== Preparing for death ==

Aside from wills, goodbyes, organ donations and funerals, there is important personal experience to decide to pass on, or not, when someone knows they may soon die.  Palliative care focuses on basic decisions people make when they are very close to the end of their lives, and it ensures someone is always available to talk to them.  It is a replacement for heroic medical intervention that may keep them physically alive but with no [[quality of life]].  Human [[psychology]] must prepare for death if it is anything other than a quick surprise:

[[Elizabeth Kubler-Ross]] wrote that there were several stages in [[dying]], of which denial was the first, and acceptance was the last.  Recording one's life is often something people with acceptance will do to leave a [[memoir]] or a full [[autobiography]]:

Because events leave [[living memory]], and may only be part of [[oral tradition]], there are projects to record everything that people remember about [[World War I]] and the [[Shoah]].  The first of these was to record everything remembered about the [[U.S. Civil War]].  This discipline has changed [[history]] since we have so many more [[first person account]]s of the times, and made [[social history]] much more standard.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''diesel-electric''' [[engine]] burns [[diesel]] or [[biodiesel]] [[fuel]]. However, rather than use this [[energy]] directly to run gears, it charges a [[battery]] which more efficiently turns wheels.

Some designs also store [[braking energy]] in a [[flywheel]], which can also charge a battery. However, these make the engine even more complex, and add weight to the vehicle, so are more appropriate for [[city driving]] where [[service station]]s are always available and there is much [[stop and go driving]].

Because they do not require any change or [[investment]] in stations nor much in [[vehicle design]], diesel-electric vehicles are believed to be the most likely replacement for today's [[internal combustion engine]]. When properly tuned, they have low [[emission]]s and they use only about one-third of the [[fossil fuel]] of most [[gasoline]] engines powering similar vehicles.

[[Honda]] and [[Toyota]] are presently delivering consumer priced diesel-electric cars. By contrast, [[hydrogen infrastructure]] is thought to be decades off, and is not fully implemented even in [[Iceland]] where there is abundant free [[geothermal electricity]].

Many [[activist]]s feel that promoting hydrogen is a stall, a way to avoid forcing the shift to diesel-electric vehicles in the nearer term.

{{wiktionary|Europe}}
'''Europe''' is a [[continent]], the western part of [[Eurasia]]. It is not part of [[Asia]], because of a [[tradition]]al [[east]]ern [[border|boundary]] that includes the [[Ural Mountains]] in [[Russia]] and the [[Bosporus]] in [[Turkey]], and from [[Africa]] by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to Balkans. The [[Atlantic Ocean]] is to the west of Europe. There are over 50 countries in Europe. [[Andreas M. Kaplan]] describes Europe as &quot;embracing maximum cultural diversity at minimal geographical distances&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006|title=Andreas M. Kaplan: European Management and European Business Schools: Insights from the History of Business Schools, European Management Journal, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union]] is made up of most of the countries in Europe. The city with the most people in Europe is [[Istanbul]].

== Origin of Name ==

Europe is named after a person in Greek [[mythology]] called Europa. She was said to have been abducted to [[Crete]] by Zeus. The name was later used for [[Greece]]. Then as the rest of the area we call Europe started to have cities and empires, the whole area West of the [[Ural Mountains]] became known by the same name.

== Regions ==

*[[Eastern Europe|Eastern]]
*[[Central Europe|Central]]
*[[Western Europe|Western]]
*[[Northern Europe|Northern]]
*[[Southern Europe|Southern]] and [[Southeastern Europe]]

== Climate ==
In Europe there are different [[climate]]s in different places; for example, in the north like [[Finland]] it stays snowy in the winter for 5–6 months and is about -30 degrees Celsius. However, during winter in [[Spain]] it is warmer and hardly snows, except on high mountains.

== European Union ==

At this time, much of the continent shares some rulership in a body that is above any country, called the [[European Union]].
